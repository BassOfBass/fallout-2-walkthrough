  p.
    Welcome to my <i>Fallout 2</i> guide/walkthrough. This guide exists because I realized that if I wanted the kind of complete <i>Fallout 2</i> guide that I envisioned, it pretty much meant writing it myself. That turned out to be quite an undertaking, but on the other hand, as far as I'm concerned <i>Fallout 2</i> is the best computer game ever made.<br><br>

  p.
    This guide is an attempt to provide a thorough presentation of the things you can do in <i>Fallout 2</i>: quests to perform, places to go, people to eat. It is not, on the other hand, an attempt to compile reams of game data such as documenting every karma point gained or lost, because it wouldn't be much fun. For game mechanics, detailed item stats and such, consult the manual and/or available in-game information. The basic assumption is that players want to squeeze as much out of their game as possible - which is another thing that makes writing this guide worthwhile, because <i>Fallout 2</i> is a game that just keeps on giving. There are details and aspects you won't notice until your second, third or fourth game, playing different characters with different attitudes. Or until you read this guide, anyway.<br><br>

  p.
    I've been playing the game using the UK edition, patch version 1.02e plus the "children patch". To my knowledge there is not a single significant difference between the UK and US versions except for the children thing. I've also used Falche2 Character Editor 2.10 and Inventory Editor 1.01 extensively to try out situations and features; moreover I've used Fallout 2 DAT explorer v1.42 to unpack game files, Fallout Items Mode Editer 1.1 to check out some item details, Fallout Utility for Critter tinKering 0.62 to check out some critter data, and the script decompilers by TeamX and Noid as well as the scripts that came with the Fallout 2 Mapper to check lots of things. Since trainers, utilities and mods aren't part of the game, I won't deal with them specifically. I don't recommend cheating, other than momentarily for the purpose of experiencing things that you wouldn't normally see, or in a last-ditch attempt to save a doomed character.<br><br>

  p.
    Virtually every piece of information or advice presented here has been verified in personal testing or playing experience, although I have of course consulted rather a lot of existing walkthroughs and board postings for snippets of information and things to try out. Sadly, many guides are either poorly written ("klammth this place stinks btr get sum quest!!! i need the xp!!!!!"), give embarrassingly bad advice ("So that's why I always tag Throwing, First Aid and Barter"), include patently false information ("If you keep the Pipe Gun in one of your active item slots it will give you Agility +3, it doesn't work for all characters"), or are glaringly incomplete ("I've heard there is a place called New Reno in this game but I never found it"). Hopefully this guide should avoid those pitfalls with some margin to spare.<br><br>

  p.
    Of other <i>Fallout 2</i> writings I would recommend those of Whitechocobo666, author of the <i>Endings FAQ</i>, the <i>Perks FAQ</i>, the <i>Weapon/armour FAQ</i> and the <i>Evil Walk-through</i>; Steve Metzler, whose <i>Steve's Guide to Fallout 2</i> was my original source of inspiration; Chris Avellone, co-designer of the game and maker of the <i>Fallout Bible</i>; and also Cristian Golumbovici. General credit goes to the people on the No Mutants Allowed message board. Special thanks to SÃ©bastien Caisse a.k.a. Red! for checking scripts and stuff for guide version 1.0.<br><br>

  p.
    Please note that <b>spoilers abound</b>. The first time you play a game like this, you really shouldn't be using any kind of walkthrough whatsoever. If you don't care enough about the unique experience of finding out and doing things on your own to abstain from spoiling it, you probably have better things to do with your time than play the game at all. So, in case this is your first game, don't read beyond Preparations.<br><br>

  p.
    If you spot typos, have something to contribute or want to complain that my inclusion criteria are arbitrary, please <a href="mailto:pel@zeta.telenordia.se">mail me</a>. If you have a gameplay or technical question that doesn't have anything to do with the guide itself (unless it hints at a deficiency therein), please turn to a message board; there are several on the net. I'm sorry, but you must understand that I'm not a one-person helpline. At least do a couple of string searches before you decide the answer isn't in the guide already.<br><br>

    br
    |--The Chosen One

  p.
    First of all you should find out if you need to patch your game. Originally this game existed in five different versions: the US edition, two UK editions (normal and low violence), and two localized editions in German and French respectively. Before playing you should locate, download and install the </a><a href="http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/dload.php">patch</a> (v1.02) for your version, since this will <i>drastically</i> improve performance and gameplay from the unpatched version of the game. This is all in the readme file, by the way. Always read those. In the walkthrough, notes that are only relevant to the unpatched game will be marked with red stars, i.e. as being largely uninteresting. If you have any kind of budget re-release or new localized version I don't think there should be any need to patch the game, but for your own sake you should make sure.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Install the patch before you start playing, since saves made in the unpatched game will be invalidated. There is an unofficial save game converter, but I think it only works on US saves and not on any of the European versions.

    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | You can use the US executable with the UK version if you are bothered by the CD lock of the latter. To my knowledge there are no harmful consequences to this. As an aside, there are a few known purely textual differences between the US and UK versions concerning "sensitive" words: "drug" has become "chem", and "addiction" has become "reliance" (but the "Addict" tab in the main interface is still the same). The reason why is anyone's guess, but if you've been wondering where I got this "chem" word from, that's the explanation.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | There is no official patch for the English Low Violence edition (marked ELV on the CD), but it's been reported that using either the US or UK patch works fine, even though it says in the readme that "applying a patch from any of the other versions will severely corrupt the game". You might want to go for the US patch, because of the CD lock thing. (Actually what I'd really recommend is not having anything to do with that product in the first place.)

  p.
    I also strongly recommend, if you have any other version than the US one, that you download the so-called children patch. This set of files, which is not technically a patch at all, will add the in-game children which have been removed from these versions (for some obscure reason of law or policy which apparently did not apply at all to <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, where you can roast kids with Fireballs all you want). You don't need any additional code, it's all there already. If you don't have the kid files, you'll miss out on a few quests, be exposed to invisible pilferers and be confounded by bodiless voices, which is all bad. You have been warned.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | The contents of the children patch are simply the kid graphics files which have been copied raw from the US CD, and what's been done to the UK version to remove the kids is simply keeping those same files off the CD. Interestingly enough, Interplay's customer support used to deny all this, but I suppose that would have to be their official line.
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A somewhat edited Ashmo: "The German version has no kids and only the 'low violence' deaths. People drop dead. If you set it to normal violence rather than none, they drop dead and bleed. The preferences screen is a bit different as there are only two options on the violence control. You need to get the gore patch (which usually includes the children patch) and then edit the config file to set the violence level higher (setting it to 3 should do the trick). The alternative is to get the executable from the US or UK version and overwrite yours." 

  p.
    Saving and loading times in the unpatched version can be as long as a minute or more. There are at least three ways of improving this to an acceptable 3-10 seconds:

  ol
    li Install the patch!
    li Use the large installation size instead of the humongous. This may seem counter-intuitive, but it works that way on many computers.
    li Shut down or disable programs running in the background, such as virus scanners.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | I have also found on my own computer that Windows instability has at times caused a significant increase to loading times and that restarting the computer takes care of this. Your system may have its own peculiarities. On fast computers loading times may not be an issue at all, but there are always other problems that crop up to compensate.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | One potential problem that relates to processor speed concerns world map travel. On some fast computers, you will zip across the map and have virtually no encounters. Conversely, on computers that can barely run the game you might experience slow travel with numerous interruptions (though this should be a less frequent issue). There are hacks you can use to restore travel speed to a more reasonable level, or you could try running an emulator.

  p.
    Save often! Ideally you should quicksave after every battle and before every conversation. Having to play even a few minutes' worth of shootin' and lootin' all over again because you made the wrong choice in a dialogue can be irksome. (Of course it may also happen that you realize only afterwards that you've done something wrong and wish you had <i>not</i> saved...) I'd also recommend keeping a save game slot for each time you enter a new major location (town etc.). This way if you really screw up somehow and only find out after you save (it can happen), you "only" have to replay that area. These saves can also come in handy later on if you want to see what would have happened if you'd done differently in a particular quest.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A little word of warning about quicksave: as you probably know the quicksave function is "reset" when you use the regular load or save commands. However, it's not reset if you exit the current game and start a new character.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Once you fill up your quota of slots you can use a file manager of your choice to make room for new ones. Just rename a save game folder (those named "Slot01" through "Slot10") you don't need for the moment to something which gives you a hint of what it contains (like "Slot02-klam"), and that slot will be free for use again. Then whenever you want to bring back an archived save, restore that folder's name to a valid one. You can use a similar trick to swap between whole save catalogues by renaming the "Savegame" folder to "SavegameX" or something else. This way you can juggle different games with different characters.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A more "realistic" approach to the game involves using a single save slot and reloading only if you die or screw up entirely by mistake (but not, for instance, if you fail some action or have second thoughts about something). Not recommended at all for beginners. Also better use at least one more slot for backup just in case your save files are corrupted. An even more realistic playing style called "iron man" involves never saving the game <i>at all</i> except between playing sessions; if you die, you're dead and have to start all over again! (Though I suspect that very few people have actually stuck with this concept to the bitter end, for instance after dying in NCR because you forgot to holster your weapons or in a freak random encounter with super mutants.)

  p.
    Entering the options screen (which can also be reached from within the game, of course, the difference being that these settings will be used in new games but do not affect existing ones, while changes made in saved games will carry over to this screen), I'd change the following default settings: combat speed to fastest (check the box), target highlight to "on" (helps you see what's happening to critters behind walls), and running to "always". If you've played through the game a few times already you may want to consider raising the difficulty levels to hard/rough.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | If you hold down Shift and press the credits button on the starting screen, you'll get to read a quote file from the developers. Good for a laugh!
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | You can access some sort of recording mode if you press #[span.no-break #[kbd Ctrl] + #[kbd R]] on the starting screen. You get to choose an area and run around it (with Narg), but you can't talk to people (unless you set off some script) or manipulate objects except for opening doors. This also creates a "selfrun" directory in your game folder where the recording is stored. When you're fed up, press #[span.no-break #[kbd Ctrl] + #[kbd R]] again to return to the starting menu. If you now wait for a while, one of your recordings will start playing, more or less accurately. The most interesting thing about this is that it shows a few unimplemented or unreachable areas, namely the Holy Hand Grenade encounter (see the Addenda section for more on this), a third Den area (with Smitty and Anna in it), and the inside of the space shuttle (which doesn't have any proper graphics). See the Area walkthrough section for a way to exploit this in the game.

  p.
    There's a particular bug I want to tell you about right away, the "too many items" bug, because when it strikes you won't necessarily have any clue what causes it (unless you read this, that is). In brief, if you collect too many items (e.g. if you aim at hoarding every quest item in the game in the trunk), this will corrupt save files and make the game crash. Normally you shouldn't need to worry, but if you spot the skilldex button going black while you're playing, you're in the danger zone. See Addenda for more info and a way to counter this bug if the worst comes to the worst.

  h3#char Character design

  blockquote "You'd think there's only ten kinds of people in the world. Way I figure it, there was some big cloning accident in the past." 
    br
    | --Mason

  p.
    The SPECIAL system used for <i>Fallout 2</i> character design is so flexible that a complete run-down on possible types isn't feasible nor desirable. I'll center this discussion on a character type which has worked very well for me and try to argue briefly why it does. If the four extremes of character creation are the ones known as diplomat, thief, sniper and brawler, mine is a kind of small guns generalist who can in time excel at everything. It is somewhat similar to the one popularly known as "diplosniper", although some details such as my liking of Fast Shot may run counter to that definition. In any case you'll gain a lot more xp than in <i>Fallout</i>, which is why there's really no need to choose a specific path.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | The pre-defined characters are generally considered to suck dead gophers (e.g. Narg has Throwing, Mingan has Skilled and Chitsa has Barter). One of the nicest things about most computer RPGs is creating your own character or characters, anyway; even if I wanted a "Mingan" character, I'd make one instead of taking Mingan.

  p.
    Gender plays a negligible role in the game. Bartering is only affected if you also have the Sex Appeal trait. The only noteworthy differences are that male characters can donate genetic material in Vault City and date Phyllis, while female characters can sleep with Metzger, Little Jesus and T-Ray for money or favours and can get hired by Miss Kitty to go to the Stables. There are several more people that will only sleep with characters of a specific gender (e.g. Angela Bishop, Slim Picket, Fannie Mae), but not much comes of it. Stupid characters can only box if they're male.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Age is not checked in any of the scripts. A nice detail is that your character will age as time goes by in the game (well, maybe the opposite would have been strange, but it's nice anyway, isn't it?).

  h4 Stats

  p.
    When allotting char points there are some things to keep in mind:

  ul
    li
      <b>Strength:</b> Extremely useful for... carrying stuff. Believe me, this is a game in which you'll want to carry stuff. You should start out with at least 5 (especially if you're taking Small Frame). However, since ST can be increased by 6 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, armour +4), I wouldn't recommend going any higher than that; even if you go for the full 10 it will mostly be noticeable in the beginning stages of the game (and a waste towards the end).
    li
      <b>Perception:</b> Good for ranged combat. A starting minimum of 5 is required for the Awareness perk, but there are quest benefits to setting it to 6 even for HtH characters. Can be increased by 2 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1).
    li
      <b>Endurance:</b> Determines Hit Points and not much else. Unless you like close combat a little too much I wouldn't put more than 4 (and anyway, two extra points to EN still only means some 30 extra HP by the end of the game). Can be increased by only 1 point during the game (perk +1).
    li
      <b>Charisma:</b> Useful for keeping your dialogue options open, though not nearly so important as Intelligence. Affects bartering both directly and indirectly. Your maximum number of followers is equal to your CH divided by two, rounded down. Even if you don't plan to keep any company you might want to set it to 2 so you can at least pick up NPCs temporarily for xp and such. Can be increased by 3 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, shades +1).
    li
      <b>Intelligence:</b> Unless you plan to rely on brute force for everything, this is likely your most important statistic since it rules conversation and determines extra skill points per level. 7 is a balanced value since it means you only need one Mentats for the few occasions where you need to go higher, though anything up to and including 9 is probably not too much. Can be increased by 3 points during the game (perk +1, surgery +1, weird brain alignment +1).
    li
      <b>Agility:</b> Determines your Action Points, so you don't want less than 6, and starting with anything up to 10 doesn't hurt. Can be increased by only 1 point during the game (perk +1).
    li
      <b>Luck:</b> As the effects of Luck are not so obvious, it's easy to perceive it as the trash stat of the system (much like Charisma usually is everywhere else). It does have an impact on your rate of critical hits, especially with the Sniper perk in place, but early in the game you won't suffer much from a low Luck score. It can be improved by 3 points during the game (perk +1, either a weird brain alignment +2 or another weird brain alignment +1).

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Stats can never be effectively raised above 10. Of those stat rises mentioned above, the "weird alignment" which gives IN +1 and LK +1 and the other which gives LK +2 are mutually exclusive. Also evil characters will normally lose out on the "surgery" IN +1 bonus.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A Strength of 5 is enough to handle virtually all weapons early on and many later ones as well (HK P90c, Gauss Pistol, Pulse Rifle). ST 6 is needed for some mid- or late-game weapons such as the Gauss Rifle and Bozar, and ST 7 for all kinds of miniguns, which means that once you get the Power Armor you can pick and choose anyway. If you use a Bozar with ST 5 you "only" get a <nobr>-20%</nobr> penalty which can be balanced with skill points, whereas the stat point can be put to better use.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | EN, CH and AG all work in the way that an odd score will not give you any significant advantages compared to the even number below, e.g. AG 6 or 7 both give you 8 Action Points. Keep this in mind, but also keep in mind ways of increasing stats later; with an odd starting AG, the Gain Agility perk becomes an extra Action Boy, which it wouldn't otherwise.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | As listed in the patch notes, the correct amount of extra HP per level is EN/2+2 (rounded down).

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | You can eat Mentats and recruit party members while your CH is high; you won't lose them when your CH returns to normal (except in the rare case of CH 1 and Lenny). Note however that this will only let you raise your CH by 2, which corresponds to one extra NPC (unless you use the save/load trick - see the Items section). Although there are other ways to improve your CH, in my opinion the best NPCs are the ones found early in the game anyway.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | In v1.0, getting the car would effectively raise your maximum number of NPCs by one, so that under optimal conditions you could have six of them. The readme mentions this has been fixed for Goris, but actually all of them had the same problem and the same fix.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you set IN lower than 4, your character will (usually) only be able to speak in grunts, unable to carry on any meaningful dialogue. Needless to say this will severely impair your ability to take on and solve quests, but you can use Mentats to help with that. (Note that you can also use Mentats "in reverse" during a normal game - take one or two and wait one hour for your stats to drop below normal - if you want to take advantage of an IN&lt;4 feature. Psycho is even more effective.) For more details, see the Stupid section.

  <h4>Traits</h4>

  p.
    Recommended traits:

  ul
    li
      <b>Small Frame:</b> One more stat point and not "some Action Points" like the manual says. Carrying stuff is nice (mmm... stuff), but not crucial once you learn what to keep and what to stow away.
    li
      <b>One Hander:</b> Many of the best weapons in the game are two-handed, but it's good for HtH characters since the bonus applies for Unarmed-class weaponry, none of which is two-handed (your completely unaided punch and kick attacks are unaffected).
    li
      <b>Finesse:</b> Decent trade-off. Like the More Criticals perk this is made obsolete by the Sniper (with high LK) or Slayer perks, but Finesse will benefit you from the very start of the game.
    li
      <b>Fast Shot:</b> A personal favourite, because I like firing a pistol five or six times during a round. When you get Sniper, it rocks, and sticking to burst weapons makes the drawback irrelevant. Don't take this if you're a hard-core sniper though.
    li
      <b>Gifted:</b> The stat bonuses counteract the skill penalties (especially if you put a few extra points to IN), so this is universally regarded as the best trait. I don't use it myself because it almost feels like cheating, or at the very least it spoils the challenge of balancing your stats.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Geoffrey Bateman opines on Small Frame (which I originally rated as a poor trait): "You lose a little Carry Weight, but you'll get Sulik soon, and then maybe a couple more mules, then a car, and Power Armor... Small Frame makes the game a <i>little</i> tougher for a <i>brief</i> while, and in return you get a character point (which could be used for, say, an extra point of IN and 2 skill points per level)."

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Fast Shot doesn't work with HtH attacks, but still removes your ability to make targeted blows (meaning it's actively bad for mÃªlÃ©e characters). This is a change from <i>Fallout</i>.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you raise a stat with Bruiser, Small Frame or Gifted, you can redistribute the extra <nobr>point(s)</nobr> manually, so think of them as extra generic char points, although technically this is not so (which is reflected by the fact that you can't lower the raised stats below certain values, but that should never be a problem).

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Paul Melin points out that if you were going to set IN to 10 anyway, the skill point loss from Gifted cannot be offset. Sure, but how many skill points can you find a use for anyway?

  p.
    Potentially useful but not overly worthwhile traits:

  ul
    li
      <b>Heavy Handed:</b> Helpful early on, but downright awful late in the game when you'll actually do less damage than if you didn't have this trait.
    li
      <b>Jinxed:</b> Could be useful in a pure (and weird) HtH game. If you or your party members are using guns yourself you shouldn't want to randomize combat unless you're always worse at it than the critters you'll be fighting (in which case you may want to rethink your playing style entirely).
    li
      <b>Good Natured:</b> Effectively a skill point boost, since you gain more useful points (Doctor, Speech) than you lose useful ones (Small Guns or Melee Weapons), but marginal in the long run. Unmissable in a pure diplomat game, if you get around to playing one of those.
    li
      <b>Sex Appeal:</b> Admit it, you always wanted this.

  ul
    li 
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Sex Appeal is mostly for female characters, since you'll be dealing with more men in the game world. Even so it won't be an important factor. If you have a low CH it will have a noticeable effect on bartering (almost all shopkeepers are male). It has no positive effect if your CH is 10, and no negative effect if your CH is 1.

  p.
    Traits to avoid:

  ul
    li
      <b>Fast Metabolism:</b> Both effects are utterly marginal, so it's simply an utterly marginal trait.
    li
      <b>Bruiser:</b> Two more stat points, but you need the AP. That's like losing four points of Agility, which is ridiculous.
    li
      <b>Kamikaze:</b> Trade away protection for Sequence which matters only during the first combat round? No thanks.
    li
      <b>Bloody Mess:</b> Fun to begin with (for instance, start up a game and beat up Klint), but doesn't do anything in game terms, and gets tiresome. You'll see those animations anyway and it will feel more like a reward (!) without this trait.
    li
      <b>Skilled:</b> With a decent IN you'll be swimming in skill points. A horrible trait, avoid like the plague (unless you have IN 1 or something, though it beats me why you would).
    li
      <b>Chem Reliant:</b> The average time you spend being addicted won't change, so what's the big deal? Chem use is marginal anyway and most players will probably just reload if they get addicted.
    li
      <b>Chem Resistant:</b> Jet is the only chem with a short enough duration that the downside matters much, but even so it's little more than a convenience (you don't have to reload as often).

      | Jon Lynch makes an interesting argument: "The Skilled trait is not as bad as it seems. Every 12 levels, someone with this trait will fall exactly one perk behind. However, they will also have accumulated 60 more skill points in this time. Since most perks that add skill points tend to give 20-40 of them, you're getting approximately double the points and they can also be placed in any skill, whereas the perks allocate the points for you." Still, this assumes you were going to get a skill point perk, which usually isn't your greatest priority. At level 24 I'd much rather have two more perks than 120 extra skill points.

  h4 Skills

  p.
    Recommended skills to tag:

  ul
    li
      <b>Small Guns:</b> Because you should be using this for your primary combat skill for most of the game.
    li
      <b>Lockpick:</b> Because there are many, many locked containers and doors and you'll want to open them with a minimum of fuss.
    li
      <b>Speech:</b> Because you want people to like you and be impressed with you and give you quests and generally do what you tell them to.

  p.
    There simply isn't any other skill which comes close to the usefulness of these three, at least if you're playing the game my way. Tag them and bump them up to around 100% early on (except possibly Small Guns if you want more use out of those Guns and Bullets magazines), it will pay off. A mÃªlÃ©e character will want one of these instead of Small Guns:

  ul
    li
      <b>Melee Weapons:</b> Unless you make this your primary combat skill you never really have to use it. If you do, tag it and pump it to 100% as soon as possible.
    li
      <b>Unarmed:</b> This is used in a few quests, but you don't have to spend any skill points here since it can be raised for free to about 100% anyway. Unless you're going Unarmed all the way I'd wait till after that to make it my primary combat skill.

  p.
    With that taken care of you can start raising your secondary skills:

  ul
    li
      <b>Big Guns:</b> Fun, but only used late in the game and so not worth a tag.
    li
      <b>Energy Weapons:</b> See Big Guns.
    li
      <b>Doctor:</b> You'll want this up to 75% eventually, but not worth a tag.
    li
      <b>Traps:</b> There aren't that many traps in the game, actually, and they're not likely to kill you. You could raise it to 60-70% for convenience, but feel free to ignore this skill altogether.
    li
      <b>Science:</b> Can be raised with books. You'll want at least 81% eventually, but don't use any points until you have to.

  p.
    Skills you will use but need not spend points on:

  ul
    li
      <b>First Aid:</b> Does little that Doctor doesn't do better. Don't use any skill points on this, raise it with books.
    li
      <b>Repair:</b> Can be raised with books, so don't use points here.
    li
      <b>Outdoorsman:</b> Can be raised with books, although those are rare. Mostly good for avoiding annoying random encounters.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you've been wondering what First Aid <i>does</i> do better than Doctor, it comes with a free +20% bonus to your skill check. And... that's pretty much it, I think.

  p.
    Rather pointless skills:

  ul
    li
      <b>Throwing:</b> Rocks and grenades simply don't play a huge role in the world of <i>Fallout 2</i>.
    li
      <b>Sneak:</b> I'm sorry, but I don't see the point of sneaking past people when you can just blow them up instead (or maybe that's the point, you sneak up and plant dynamite? Unfortunately there's not enough dynamite to employ this tactic consistently).
    li
      <b>Steal:</b> Don't bother unless either you don't mind if everyone turns hostile on you, or you plan to save and reload a lot (which isn't my favoured playing style). If you really must steal something, you can usually do it with a low skill level (saving first, of course).
    li
      <b>Barter:</b> Early in the game there won't be a whole lot to buy. Later in the game you'll be swimming in money. Don't waste a single skill point here. Unless you raise the skill way above 100% your CH will have a greater impact on bartering anyway.
    li
      <b>Gambling:</b> See Barter.

      | Your amount of unspent skill points is capped at 99 when you level up. You can have more than 99 points stored (e.g. after getting a skill point perk), but only until you level up next time.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A "cheat": when buying a non-combat skill which is slightly above 100%, raise the difficulty to hard (assuming you usually play on normal). Your skill will drop below 100% so you only have to spend one skill point per skill level. Afterwards return the difficulty setting to normal or whatever. This also works when reading books; see the Items section for a note on this.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Similarly you can set the difficulty to easy to raise your skills temporarily for a specific action (again assuming you're playing on normal or hard).
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Some players actually favour the Sneak skill as in some situations it will let you kill people without anyone noticing, which is useful in assassinations. It can also be useful for HtH characters to get as close to the enemy as possible before they open fire. It doesn't much help with stealing, though, as in almost every shop where the wares are kept in an onscreen container the script simply doesn't take sneaking into account.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | I'll put a couple of Steal notes here, because they don't seem to fit anywhere else. You gain a bonus (or suffer a smaller penalty) stealing from the back or side of someone, but the Sneak skill does nothing. Item size (which is not the same as weight) is a factor unless you have the Pickpocket perk. Regardless of your skill level you can use Steal to see what humanoid critters are carrying, although you won't see items they're holding or items that they "produce" during the course of a quest.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you manage to steal and/or plant an item two or more times in succession you gain an increasing amount of xp for each successful attempt: 10, 20, 30 and so on, meaning the total will be 10, 30, 60 and so on. However, the total amount will cap out at 300 minus your Steal level, and if you're caught you get none at all. Low-level thief characters can benefit from this by stealing "one coin at a time" from potential victims (or swapping an item back and forth). Personally I'd try to think of something more meaningful to do.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | In some shops you can use Steal on the shopkeeper or a container to take stuff and/or money; in others you can't because the wares are kept in an offscreen container when you're not talking to the shopkeeper or because some scripting feature prevents it. In the latter case wares will appear on the body of the shopkeeper only if you kill them, and perhaps not even then.

      | Starseeker adds this on Steal: "I have found out that if you have low Lockpick skills, you can try to steal stuff from locked drawers or tables, but it may not always work for some reason. It won't work on lockers." Experimentation shows that it works on desks and workbenches, but not on lockers or footlockers.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | You can plant items on people using Steal. The only use of this feature I know of, except giving equipment to your NPCs, is to arm an explosive, put it on someone, then whistle innocently and walk away a bit. But don't save your game before it goes off; it's been reported that this can corrupt your save slot completely!

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | A tip from Masklinn: "Some people don't show their weapons (sometimes other items, but mainly weapons) in the thieving interface but accept to barter them. Just enter the barter interface, put the weapon in the trading area, then go back and quit dialogue; quite a lot of people will have put the item where you can see it in the thieving interface and you can now steal it."

  p.
    As a rule, it's not worth it to raise most skills above 101%. Combat skills can be improved beyond that for an extra edge until you reach the point where you get the maximum 95% chance to hit against all opponents and from any reasonable range (which takes a bit longer if you practice the art of aimed shots or blows). Unarmed is an exception if you make use of the HtH Evade perk, though at high levels you'll have to spend quite a lot of skill points for each point of AC. Science has a few uses above 101%; most are strictly marginal, but go for it if you don't have anything else to do with the points. Most often you can just try again if you fail a skill check, even in dialogue. Sneak, Steal and Outdoorsman might seem like exceptions since failure has more of an immediate effect in these cases, but your rate of success hardly rises linearly with skill level anyway; quite likely the chance of success for Steal and Sneak is capped at 95% even before modifiers are applied, just like Outdoorsman.

  h4 Perks

  p.
    The three top perks, hands down:

  ul
    li
      <b>Awareness:</b> Extremely useful. This should be your first perk (which means you should always start with a minimum PE of 5).
    li
      <b>Bonus Rate of Fire:</b> In conjunction with Fast Shot this is so good.
    li
      <b>Sniper:</b> <i>The</i> sniper perk which will allow you to take on opponents like the Navarro and Enclave troops confidently.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | In case you need to raise a stat with a perk in order to qualify for another perk, make sure you get this in time. Ideally you should have a good idea when you start playing which perks to take at which level. If you don't have the stats to meet the requirements of a perk you can in some cases use drugs to raise them temporarily and get the perk, but this does not work with perks that have a Luck requirement, for instance. Check out the chems in the Items section for details. Also remember you must spend each perk before earning a new one.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Some have asked me about Sniper and how it interacts with effects that modify your Critical Chance; specifically, the observation has been made that "Sniper and non-aimed" can produce less crits than "aimed and non-Sniper". Basically this is correct for values of Luck below 6. How I think Sniper works, and which is borne out by shooting the pariah dog a great number of times, is that it doesn't replace your usual crit chance but instead adds an independent possibility of a critical hit. If you have Luck 4 you'd normally get crits 4% of the time, with Sniper you'd increase that to 42% (40% from the perk plus 4% of the remaining cases). Using targeted shots to the eyes which increase the crit chance by 60%, you'd have a "normal" chance of 64%, going to 78% with Sniper. In the latter case you'd "only" be up 14% as compared to 38%, and expressed as a fraction of the original crit chance the difference in gain is much greater. Sniper would still add something, though, in this case roughly equivalent to three levels of More Criticals. Similarly, making aimed shots will improve your effective crit chance even if you have Sniper, though the benefit is smaller at high values of LK (12% at LK 8 and 6% at LK 9 for eye shots) and you might then be better served by the extra shot or two afforded by Fast Shot. By contrast, the benefit of More Criticals fades to insignificance even at moderate LK if you have Sniper. With Sniper and LK 10 you get crits all the time, but you can still get more damaging and/or debilitating ones by making aimed shots.

  p.
    Recommended perks (number of ranks in parentheses):

  ul
    li
      <b>Action Boy (2):</b> Whether you need this, and if so how many levels, depends on your current Action Points and what weapons you plan to use. Try to get an even multiple of your weapon's AP cost (or a multiple plus reloading cost if ranged).
    li
      <b>Better Criticals:</b> Yummy.
    li
      <b>Bonus HtH Attacks:</b> Great for brawlers. (HtH just isn't as efficient as ranged combat.)
    li
      <b>Bonus Move (2):</b> A good early choice for HtH characters, and arguably pretty useful for anyone.
    li
      <b>Gain Agility:</b> Good if your new AG is an even number, which means an extra Action Point. Otherwise don't bother, it will only net you a few skill points.
    li
      <b>Living Anatomy:</b> Very good, 5 more damage per attack <i>and</i> Doctor points although you may not need them at this stage.
    li
      <b>Quick Pockets:</b> Actually this is a break early in the game when you find yourself needing Stimpaks or Healing Powder at times, and an overall convenience later on.
    li
      <b>Slayer:</b> The ultimate HtH perk (and unlike Sniper you don't need to make a LK roll).

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Michal Burger puts in: "The Bonus Move perk is for an HtH character far superior to Action Boy/Girl, which you suggested, because your enemies tend to slide 2-8 hexes after you hit them so you almost always use up all of your 'move only' Action Points, even if you have two levels of this perk. Another advantage is that you can get Bonus Move at 6th level, compared to 12th for Action Boy. I can never find any good perks at the early levels, so I almost always go for Toughness and Bonus Move. And some extra move AP can be still useful even in ranged combat - for hiding behind obstacles." This argument was made for <i>Fallout</i> where the Super Sledge is the best mÃªlÃ©e weapon, but it has merit even without the knockback angle. Volcano adds: "I find Bonus Move has its uses in ranged combat, when using heavy burst weapons like miniguns or the Bozar. It allows you to get a clear field of fire so that you can target the enemy without blowing apart your NPCs. And it allows you to line up critters to ensure hitting more than one with each burst. Wiping out six floaters with three bursts from a Vindicator is a lot of fun."

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Bonus Move is bugged so that if you save and load the game in combat, your extra movement AP will be available for use again, allowing you to move any distance in a single round.

  p.
    Possibly useful but not crucial perks:

  ul
    li
      <b>Dodger:</b> Protection is good.
    li
      <b>Explorer, Ranger, Scout:</b> These all improve your chances of finding special encounters, which can be helpful if you have low LK and play on hard difficulty, but mostly for the fun value, so don't take them until the late game.
    li
      <b>Gain Charisma:</b> This is useful if your new CH is an even number, which means you can recruit another party member... if you <i>want</i> another party member.
    li
      <b>Gain Intelligence:</b> Unless you start out with IN 9 this is good, but not a top priority if you have IN 7-8 already, which you should.
    li
      <b>Gain Luck:</b> Good LK will help with special encounters (maybe) and criticals, so take this in the late game if you can't think of anything else. Great only if you have the Sniper perk.
    li
      <b>Gain Perception:</b> Improves your sniping and helps get the Sniper perk (but you can use chems for that). As you can see all the Gain Foo perks are rather situational.
    li
      <b>HtH Evade:</b> Strictly better than Dodger for Unarmed experts. Note that you can use unarmed weaponry such as the Power Fist with this perk, i.e. your weapon slots don't literally have to be empty (that perk description had <i>me</i> fooled).
    li
      <b>Lifegiver (2):</b> You can accumulate a lot of Hit Points with this one, but after level 12, do you need them? Probably not.
    li
      <b>Magnetic Personality:</b> For those situations where you have a lousy CH and want a large party anyway (without fooling around with chems). If your current CH is an odd number then Gain Charisma is strictly superior to this.
    li
      <b>More Criticals (3):</b> Groovy, but the catch here is that if you get Sniper (and have a good LK) or Slayer, this perk will be made largely redundant.
    li
      <b>Mutate!:</b> There's one way you can use this perk efficiently: exchanging Finesse for Fast Shot at level 27 after you get Sniper (or taking it as your level 21 perk just before reaching level 24). It then effectively becomes another Bonus Rate of Fire. Other than that, don't waste a perk changing traits in mid-game instead of choosing right to begin with.
    li
      <b>Silent Death:</b> Considering the six separate requirements for pulling this off, you'd think it'd do more than double damage!
    li
      <b>Toughness (3):</b> Protection is good (but spending char points on Endurance is not, so take Buffout if you want this). Would be more noteworthy if it affected all damage types. Note that you can eventually get to 80% DR through other means, and 90% is the maximum, so if you take more than one level of Toughness you risk not getting your money's worth.

      | It's been argued that HtH Evade and Jinxed makes for an effective combination... but hey, that's not really the most inspiring way to play this game, is it? Note that this perk was changed after the manual was printed; the in-game description is the correct one.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Although it's not clear from the description, Lifegiver gives you +4 Maximum HP when you take it; you could say it works retroactively for the level you just earned.

      | Frank Shannon is not alone when he says: "I'm a little surprised you rated Lifegiver so low." Well, if you take two levels of Lifegiver as quickly as you can and play to level 30, you will have 140 more HP, and it's true that this makes for a good safety margin, especially in an iron man game. However, by that time you'll have run around in heavy armour and with resistance bonuses for a good while and you seldom have to worry about being slain outright except by massive critical hits that bypass armour. Lifegiver could save you in such a moment - and so could Dodger, abstractly speaking. Meanwhile, offensive perks which add attacks, manoeuvrability or damage will be working for you constantly. I'd consider taking Lifegiver before I considered dumping more char points in Endurance, but I still find it limited in appeal.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you have CH 8 or 9 and didn't get the Mirrored Shades and/or Blue Memory Module yet, you may want to skip Magnetic Personality since you can't normally have more than 5 party members anyway. This perk is available from level 6, not level 3 as the manual states.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If you have only one trait when you get the Mutate! perk, you must exchange that for the new one, i.e. you can't just fill the other slot and keep the old trait.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Krum Stanoev adds: "There's another fairly obvious way to modify your primary stats in-game with the Mutate! perk. You can start with an Agility of 6 and still get Sniper: you pick Finesse, then you pick Gain Agility to make it 7, then Mutate! to swap Finesse for Small Frame and get AG 8 for Sniper just before you make it to level 24." (Or you could take a dose of Psycho.)

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | One could make an argument such as this: "If you use Mutate! to change any mediocre trait to Gifted, you're basically getting seven Gain Foo perks at once. That's got to be the best perk ever." The problem with this is that it assumes you didn't get Gifted from the start even though you could have. The beauty of swapping Finesse and Fast Shot is that the benefit of Finesse and the drawback of Fast Shot disappear at the same time, namely when you get Sniper.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | It's possible to score more than one double-damage hit with Silent Death in the first round of combat, assuming you can position yourself behind two or more enemies without leaving Sneak mode (which is difficult if you have to pass directly in front of them).

  p.
    Perks I rather doubt the usefulness of:

  ul
    li
      <b>Bonus HtH Damage (3):</b> Should have been a lot more damage. Now you'll have to get all three levels to notice any difference. Note that this perk adds to the <i>maximum</i> damage - that's only one point on average for each perk slot!
    li
      <b>Bonus Ranged Damage (2):</b> Not enough of a bonus unless you're using a Minigun, Bozar or the like (although if you expect to score a lot of damage multiplication criticals it gets a little better).
    li
      <b>Gain Strength:</b> You shouldn't need this to get to ST 10.
    li
      <b>Pack Rat, Strong Back (3):</b> Carrying more stuff just can't be wrong ("Pack rat you is!"), but spending perks to do it is.
    li
      <b>Pickpocket:</b> Neat for thief characters, I suppose, but effectively a convenience perk unless you really never save before stealing.
    li
      <b>Silent Running:</b> If you must play a sneaking character I guess this takes a lot of frustration out of playing, but doesn't it spoil the atmosphere? Pure convenience.
    li
      <b>Smooth Talker (3):</b> Almost the equivalent of the Gain Intelligence perk, but not quite... Better to start off with a decent IN instead, no?
    li
      <b>Tag!:</b> Since it's a skill point perk, personally I wouldn't touch it, but used correctly it can give you rather a lot of points so I'm rating it higher than the rest.
    li
      <b>Thief:</b> Pretty much the same for this. Since it gives you 40 skill points and you can get it at level 3 this is one of the best skill perks. Not that these thief skills are crucial or anything.
    li
      <b>Weapon Handling:</b> Could be used to facilitate switching to Avenger Minigun or the like early in the game, but otherwise not needed unless your ST is way too low to begin with. Just spend some skill points to compensate.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | You can play a little trick with the Tag! perk. When you use it to tag a skill, it will raise the skill level by the same amount you already raised the skill, including bonuses gained during play (but <i>not</i> the initial 20% bonus). The trick is that before leaving the character screen you can lower the skill to its previous level (gaining even more skill points if the skill went above 101%), and then spend the points elsewhere. Effectively this perk can give you an amount of generic skill points at least equal to the highest amount you've gained in a non-tagged skill, and potentially much more, which makes it far superior to every other skill point perk. Although a favourite of some players, personally I think it's no big deal, since I don't care much for skill points late in the game anyway. As pointed out by Volcano, the game keeps track of the skill level if it goes above 300%, so if you tag a skill at 299% you'll get several hundred points out of it - but if you tag a skill at 300%, you can't lower it at all!

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | When you pick a skill point perk (other than Tag!) you can redistribute points only to the extent that you have previously raised that skill by investing skill points, reading books or getting one-shot bonuses. Survivalist is probably the most likely candidate of the bunch, but it's still much inferior to Tag! for the purpose. Also note that skill point perks raise skills by a fixed amount, no matter if they are tagged (in which case you lose) or higher than 101% (in which case you profit). This redistribution trick also works on a smaller scale when you buy a perk that raises a stat.

  p.
    Useless perks which should only be chosen if you have no other options (or really want to):

  ul
    li
      <b>Adrenaline Rush:</b> Gain an infinitesimal bonus, but first you'll have to be dying? Let me think.
    li
      <b>Cautious Nature:</b> Pointless for anyone but the most cowardly diplomats who can't think of anything else.
    li
      <b>Comprehension:</b> What's the use if it doesn't raise the maximum skill level which can be reached using books? See Educated etc.
    li
      <b>Cult of Personality, Karma Beacon:</b> These perks have no effect in the game. That's right, they do nothing. Take Adrenaline Rush or Light Step if you want a better perk than these two.
    li
      <b>Demolition Expert:</b> So extremely marginal.
    li
      <b>Earlier Sequence (3):</b> Not worth it.
    li
      <b>Educated (3), Gambler, Harmless, Master Thief, Medic, Mr. Fixit, Negotiator, Salesman, Speaker, Survivalist:</b> All these perks give you nothing but skill points. You don't need more skill points. You need the cool perks listed in the sections above this one.
    li
      <b>Empathy:</b> It seems like a great idea in theory, but this game simply isn't about choosing the dialogue options that keep <i>other</i> people happy.
    li
      <b>Faster Healing (3), Healer (2):</b> Healing rate is never an issue.
    li
      <b>Fortune Finder, Master Trader:</b> Money is not an issue. Fortune Finder is just awful; Master Trader isn't actively bad, just strictly unnecessary.
    li
      <b>Gain Endurance:</b> Endurance is simply not important, and this does nothing if your EN is an even number. Lifegiver is tons better for HP.
    li
      <b>Ghost:</b> Like a skill point perk only you don't get the skill points!
    li
      <b>Heave Ho!:</b> Strictly for grenade chums, and exceptionally marginal even so.
    li
      <b>Here and Now, Swift Learner (3):</b> These two help you gain levels. What's the primary purpose of gaining levels? To get perks. So why use perks to gain more levels? If you want HP and/or skill points there are much better choices anyway.
    li
      <b>Kama Sutra Master:</b> Doesn't really do anything that Sex Appeal, Sexpert and/or good physical stats don't. A sex perk is bound to be utterly marginal.
    li
      <b>Presence (3):</b> Don't bother. Extremely few critters treat you differently depending on reaction, and this perk isn't likely to be the factor that tips the scales in your favour.
    li
      <b>Light Step:</b> Not enough traps to make this remotely worthwhile. Not even if it said "never" instead of "less likely".
    li
      <b>Mysterious Stranger:</b> Utterly useless.
    li
      <b>Night Vision:</b> Situational, and doesn't do much. Increase your weapon skill instead or pick Sharpshooter.
    li
      <b>Pathfinder (2):</b> Time is not an issue in <i>Fallout 2</i>.
    li
      <b>Pyromaniac:</b> Too marginal. Should have been a <i>lot</i> more damage to have been any fun. Also note that the (Improved) Flamer is the only weapon that does fire damage (Molotov Cocktails do not, even though they have the "dancing death by fire" animation, and Flame Breaths don't count).
    li
      <b>Quick Recovery, Stonewall:</b> Both mind-numbingly marginal.
    li
      <b>Rad Resistance (2), Snakeater (2):</b> Poison and radiation aren't common enough, or difficult enough to handle, to necessitate these small bonuses.
    li
      <b>Sharpshooter:</b> Effectively just a minimal skill increase for all ranged attacks. Increase your preferred weapon skill instead and use the perk for something special.

      | Kanhef explains Heave Ho!: "A character's maximum range for throwing weapons is ST*3. Someone with a Strength of 2 can throw things up to 6 hexes away. Taking Heave Ho! gives them an effective ST of 4, for a range of 12. However, the maximum throwing range is 8 for spears, and 15 for grenades. So raising Strength above 5 doesn't increase range at all. Characters with a Strength of 1 would benefit from this perk; it's completely useless with a Strength over 4." Throwing Knives have a maximum range of 16 hexes, but taking a perk to increase your ST 5 character's range with that particular weapon by 1 hex would seem to fall within the definition of "completely useless".

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Both Heave Ho! and Survivalist have only one rank instead of three like the manual says. Several other perks were changed (for example, all skill point perks), but their proper descriptions are in the game.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Here and Now gives you exactly the amount of xp needed to reach the next level; ideally it should be taken at a high level and after earning just enough xp to reach your current level. Well, ideally it should not be taken, but you know what I mean. You need to exit and re-enter the character screen to get the skill points and the new perk, if any. Volcano adds: "If you take Here and Now as your perk at Level 99, your accumulated xp total becomes 0. There doesn't seem to be any other effect." Taking it at level 97 gets you to level 99 (see note in the Area walkthrough introduction). This perk is available on level 3 instead of level 9 as the manual says; this is actually not a bug, but was omitted from the final patch readme.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | In v1.0 when you took Here and Now you gained an amount of xp equal to the total amount needed to reach your current level; starting at level 6 you would gain more than one level as a result, with the number of levels gained increasing with your current level. For instance, if you took the perk just after reaching level 19, you would double your total experience to 342,000 and rise to level 26. Of course, you would only be able to pick one perk afterwards. Juan adds: "When I pressed cancel and left the character screen, I saw that the text screen said 'You have gone up a level' 10 times, and my NPCs had levelled up... but they didn't lose their levels! So I tried picking and cancelling Here and Now again, and yes, my party members went gaining levels, over and over, until they reached their max level (and I still had the perk available)." With the patch NPCs will not have a chance of levelling up in this case.

      | Light Step is one of those mind-bogglingly stupid perks. Not only is the ability to avoid pressure plates decidedly minor, and not only does Light Step require you to pass a difficult AG check for each mine to do so, but they didn't even care to set this up for every floor trap in the game. In fact, the only places where Light Step is used are Redding and outside (but not inside) the SAD.

      | Contrary to what the manual says, the Master Trader perk doesn't make your own stuff more valuable, but gives you a discount on the value of goods you barter for (the <i>Fallout</i> manual has it right). The effective discount varies somewhat between shops: 20%, 25% and 50% have all been noted (probably because barter modifiers are applied cumulatively and not sequentially).

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | The Pathfinder perk appears to be slightly bugged: the first level will cut 20% of travelling time (not 25%), while the second level doesn't seem to do anything at all. In <i>Fallout</i> the perk worked as it should.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Sharpshooter is bugged and doesn't really do what the manual says; it's supposed to raise PE by 2 for sniping purposes, yet often improves your chance to hit less, and never more, than increasing PE by 1. Michal Burger figured out that this is because the perk thinks range modifiers are calculated based on PE when it's in fact PE*2, and so increases your chance to hit only half as much as it should. At least it gives you a bonus even if your PE is at 10 already.

      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | Swift Learner decisively wins the struggle for the title of most deceptively lousy perk. It may certainly seem like a good investment when you first look at it, <i>but</i> since the xp requirement for each new level rises linearly, even if you get all three slots of Swift Learner you only ever stay a few levels ahead of someone who doesn't ruin their early game wasting invaluable perks. For starters, you have to wait until level 17 before you're even <i>one</i> whole level ahead of the "slow" learner, and if you eventually get to level 30, which should not be until the game is over anyway, you'll still be only <i>two</i> levels ahead. So, that adds up <i>eventually</i> to a few HP and skill points, for three perks... Simply put, do not choose this perk even if it threatens you with a radiated stick.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
      | There are a few implemented perks which you cannot gain, namely Animal Friend, Flower Child, Mental Block and Scrounger. They were in the original <i>Fallout</i>. Rumours that you can get some or all of them in <i>Fallout 2</i> are completely unsubstantiated, and only Flower Child has any effect should you add it using a character editor.

  h4 Suggested characters

  p.
    First of all, none of that "theme character" nonsense, like tagging Science and Repair and choosing "tech perks" like Educated and Mr. Fixit, or tagging Sneak and Steal and then choosing "ninja perks" like Ghost, Pickpocket and Silent Death, or even tagging Speech and Barter and picking "diplomat perks" such as Presence, Empathy and Cult of Personality. Well, of course you could do that (and probably even finish the game), but in that case it'd be pointless for me to tell you what to do. Also I don't think you could squeeze as much out of the game as you could with a generalist. For one thing, those options will be more or less available to you anyway by the time you need them. For another thing, there are very few advantages (either minmaxing-wise or role-playing-wise) to be gained from being an "expert scientist" or "expert sneaker". Really. Wonderfully flexible as the SPECIAL system is, some characters <i>are</i> bigger than others.

  p.
    What you really need is good IN (for dialogue and skill points), good Speech, and at least one way to deliver damage efficiently. You then basically have a choice between ranged or close combat because the perk progressions are different, and another choice between going solo or gathering followers. Or you can be stupid, which is the same as, well, pitting the odds against yourself.

  p.
    The "developed" stats given below assume the following:

    li PE +1 (memory module)
    li IN +1 (memory module)
    li LK +2 (NCR zeta scan)

  p.
    Also they include Gain Foo perks if listed in the perk progressions. By default CH remains unchanged since the +2 bonus (Mirrored Shades, memory module) is countered by the enhanced combat implants.<br><br>

    li.
      Comments: Pick up Sulik, Vic and Cassidy for a posse of gunslingers. Later in the game you can switch to Big Guns (goes well with Fast Shot), perhaps in conjunction with pulse and/or gauss weapons. You need a Jet or Mentats for Sniper. Whether you should pick Living Anatomy or go for more AP is situational.

    li.
      Comments: Build Small Guns to 150% and kill everything that moves with the Scoped Hunting Rifle/Sniper Rifle/Gauss Rifle. Don't get the enhanced combat implants until you've temporarily recruited the NPCs you can get xp and other bonuses from (such as Myron's antidote quest). You can do the Mutate! thing at level 27 to get Fast Shot if you like, but you'll be pretty deadly anyway with 12 AP and a Gauss Pistol.

  p.
    <b>Team brawler:</b> A character devoted to Unarmed and Melee Weapons.

      Initial stats: ST 5, PE 6, EN 4, CH 6, IN 7, AG 9, LK 4.
    li.

    li.
      Comments: Pick up Sulik and Cassidy. CH 6 is mostly for quest purposes; theoretically you could recruit Marcus or Goris, but I actually wouldn't. You need a quick trip to NCR around level 9 to meet the LK requirement of Better Criticals. You can move two points of CH to LK if you want, but LK ultimately isn't as important for an HtH character. The reason I choose Melee Weapons over Unarmed from the start is that it's a little better in the beginning, and there are many ways of raising Unarmed for free during the game, so that it's very easy to make the switch when the time comes.

  p.
    <b>Solo brawler:</b> Same as above but with less CH. Not really an improvement, though, since you lose some quest features and mostly boost Luck in return (theoretically you could boost EN instead, but I just wouldn't bother).

    li.
      Comments: You can substitute anything you like for Fast Shot and/or Doctor. You need 2 Mentats for Bonus Rate of Fire. You don't get the combat implants, and of course you can't get any IN rise if you want to remain true to the stupid theme. You'll probably have to fight a lot of random encounters if you want Sniper before heading off to the Enclave, because of the dearth of quest xp.

  h4 Special perks

  p.
    A quick list of special perks that can be gained, detailed further in the walkthrough:

  ul

      <b>Jinxed:</b> The pariah dog will bestow this doubtful perk upon you.

  h4 Reputations

  p.
    During the game you will accumulate characteristics which are neither perks nor traits, but presented alongside them. They're often called "karmic traits", or even "perks", but the manual calls them "special reputations". They don't affect your stats (other than Prizefighter, which could just as well have been a special perk), only how people in the game world react to you.

  ul
    li.
      <b>Berserker:</b> Kill significantly more good people than bad people. Great pic!
    li.
      <b>Champion:</b> Kill significantly more bad people than good people and don't be a Childkiller.
    li.
      <b>Childkiller:</b> Kill a child for any reason, even by accident.
    li.
      <b>Gigolo:</b> Have sex a lot (or just once, providing you're extremely good at it). (For a woman, this should actually read "Gigole".)
    li.
      <b>Grave Digger:</b> Dig up a grave other than Anna's, the fallout shelter in Golgotha, or the buried ghoul in Golgotha.
    li.
      <b>Made Man:</b> Join a family in New Reno.
    li.
      <b>Married:</b> Marry Miria or Davin in Modoc.
    li.
      <b>Porn Star:</b> If you shoot a movie at the Golden Globes.
    li.
      <b>Prizefighter:</b> Win the boxing title in New Reno.
    li.
      <b>Separated:</b> Have your spouse killed or sold into slavery, or get divorced in New Reno.
    li.
      <b>Sexpert:</b> Have sex ten times.
    li.
      <b>Slaver:</b> Join Metzger's guild in the Den.

  ul
    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | The people of the <i>Fallout</i> world seem to adopt an "Einmal ist Keinmal" philosophy when it comes to childkilling. This means that even though you get the Childkiller label on your character sheet for killing one child, scripts always check to see if you've killed two kids or more (including the bounty hunters on the world map). I won't spell this out every time, though, so in the walkthrough, "Childkiller" should be read as "having killed two children or more".

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | If any of your NPCs kills a child you don't get the Childkiller reputation.

    li
      <img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
      | There are a few kids who increase your child kill count twice because of a script redundancy (and thus instantly make you a "real" Childkiller): these are Jonny in Modoc, the Slag kids, and Curtis in Vault City.

  p.
    Your actual karma level will be described using the karmic titles, from "most good" to "most evil": Savior of the Damned, Guardian of the Wastes, Shield of Hope, Defender, Wanderer, Betrayer, Sword of Despair, Scourge of the Wastes and Demon Spawn. Each 250 karma in either direction from 0 will earn you a new title. I find that being a shameless opportunist will net you high positive karma in the end - which could mean that the designers have strange notions about morality, but more likely just reflects the fact that there are more good things to do in the game than bad ones.

  p.
    Reputation in specific towns are reflected by the standings: Idolized, Liked, Accepted, Neutral, Antipathy, Hated and Vilified. Like your karma level this is a representation of a numeric value, only this one is hidden. You always start out as Neutral when you come to a place, except Klamath where you're Accepted if your CH is 6 or more, and Vault City where you start out with Antipathy. In Arroyo, of course, you're Idolized. Sadly it's not possible to reach Idolized in all settlements if that's your aim. At the Ghost Farm, for instance, you can't advance beyond Neutral even after saving all their sorry asses.

  p.
    It should be noted that karma and reputations all have a much smaller general impact on the game than one might think. They make a difference in the case of critters that look directly for certain reputations or threshold values of karma or town reputation, but the basic reaction system that factors in everything at once is hardly used at all and doesn't even work properly. It won't really make any difference whether you have 500 karma or 1500.

  h4 Radiation

  p.
    And now for some stuff on radiation, which does play a small part in the <i>Fallout</i> world. Sources of radiation include Fruit, golden geckos, and aliens and centaurs in random encounters. Whenever you get a huge dose all at once, the message window says "You have received a large dose of radiation." As explained in the patch notes, the radiation sign pops up once you've reached 66 rem.

  p.
    As far as I can tell radiation damage works like this: some time after you absorb a dose of radiation, you'll get one of the messages listed below, and you may temporarily lose stat points, Healing Rate and current Hit Points. The severity of the "attack" depends on your total rem count, but also on the amount of recent radiation that triggered the message. After 7 days, your stats will return to normal. A little confusingly, this is signalled by another message identical to the first one. If you absorb more radiation in the meanwhile, your current penalty may be replaced by a more severe one.

  p.
    Here's a list of the penalties you may suffer. The rem figures are rough approximations.

  p.
    You will expire from your condition if any of these stats except for Healing Rate (including CH) drops to 0 or below. This is checked only at the moment when they are lowered, so you may be able to use drugs to stay alive. Assuming you don't die in this manner, you can live with any kind of rem count and still run around with no penalty whatsoever. In any normal game, radiation is not a significant factor; in fact, in order to reach even 300 rem you'd have to run several laps around the Gecko reactor room or purposely hang around the Toxic waste dump. From what I can tell, there is never any permanent damage resulting from radiation.<br><br><hr>

  <a name="end"></a><h3>Endings</h3>

  <blockquote>"I won! Fuck you! You are dumb. I have crushed you."<br>
  --Wooz</blockquote>

  Here's a list of possible endings shown in the end sequence. Some of them are a little screwed up due to mistakes in the script as well as missing features. To get an ending for a location it must be named on the world map, which means you must have either entered it or had someone put it on the map.

  <h4>Arroyo</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Arroyo re-settled using G.E.C.K.: You always get this, even if you don't have any G.E.C.K. at this point (for instance, if you let both of them blow up with the Enclave).
  </li></ol>

  <h4>Modoc</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Modoc is razed after Slags are killed by the townspeople: Deliver the message, then offer to help and fail, or join the people of Modoc in an attack on the Slags.
  </li><li>Modoc disperses after Slags are killed: Kill the Slags yourself, or deliver the message and immediately refuse to do any more.
  </li><li>Modoc flourishes: Make peace between Modoc and the Slags.
  </li><li>Modoc disperses due to drought: Don't deliver the message and don't kill the Slags.
  </li></ol>

  There are two pictures for Modoc, one "apples" picture for ending 3, one "desert" picture for all the others.

  <h4>The Den</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>The Den disperses: Kill Metzger and Rebecca.
  </li><li>The Den flourishes: Kill Metzger but not Rebecca.
  </li><li>The Den becomes a haven for raiders: Don't kill Metzger, kill Big Jesus Mordino.
  </li><li>The Den becomes a slaver central: Don't kill Metzger, don't kill Big Jesus Mordino.
  </li></ol>

  There are two pictures for the Den: one "wall" picture for endings 1 and 3, one "sign" picture for endings 2 and 4.

  <h4>Vault City</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Population driven to NCR by radiation: Don't fix the power plant (blowing it up works too).
  </li><li>VC independent, Westin and Lynette marry (!): Fix the power plant, kill the raiders, expose Bishop's plan and deliver the two holodisks but do <i>not</i> collect the final reward from Randal (bug), and don't kill Westin or Lynette (obviously).
  </li><li>VC annexed by NCR: Fix the power plant, don't bring the Account Book or Bishop's Holodisk to Lynette.
  </li><li>VC becomes part of NCR: Fix the power plant, kill the raiders and bring the Account Book or Bishop's Holodisk to Lynette. (You get this one if you fail to get ending 2 for any reason, e.g. killing Westin or picking up the reward.)
  </li></ol>

  <h4>New Reno</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Everyone dead: Kill all four bosses.
  </li><li>Tribals arise: Impregnate either Bishop woman and leave her alive, and tell Mrs Bishop she should move on.
  </li><li>Bishop child: Impregnate either Bishop woman and leave her alive, but do not tell Mrs Bishop to move on.
  </li><li>Bishops rule: Leave the Bishop family in control (see below).
  </li><li>Salvatores rule: Leave the Salvatore family in control.
  </li><li>Mordinos rule: Leave the Mordino family in control, and don't get ending 7.
  </li><li>Mordinos wane: Leave the Mordino family in control, deliver Jet to Dr Troy but do <i>not</i> return for the Jet Antidote (bug).
  </li><li>Wrights seize power violently: Leave the Wright family in control, and enter the SAD.
  </li><li>Wrights attack Mordinos and get slaughtered: Leave the Wright family in control, don't enter the SAD, take but do not finish the murder quest and don't attack the Wrights.
  </li><li>Wrights rule fairly: Leave the Wright family in control, don't enter the SAD, and either finish the murder quest (in any way), turn the Wrights hostile (which sets the murder quest to finished), or do not take the murder quest at all.
  </li></ol>

  There are two pictures here, one "sign with cobwebs" picture for ending 1, one "lit sign" picture for every other ending.<br><br>

  Every family in New Reno starts out with a "power counter" at 100 which will drop as a result of your actions as follows:

  <ul>
  <li>Killing a boss: sets that family's power to 0 (well, technically to <nobr>-1</nobr>)
  </li><li>Killing a bartender, casino bouncer, generic guard or unnamed adult Wright: <nobr>-1</nobr>
  </li><li>Mordino: killing or recruiting Myron: +20 (bug), killing Little Jesus: <nobr>-1</nobr>
  </li><li>Bishop: breaking the raiders' strength: <nobr>-20</nobr>
  </li><li>Salvatore: disturbing the desert transaction: <nobr>-20</nobr>, killing Mason: <nobr>-5</nobr>
  </li><li>Wright: breaking the stills: <nobr>-20</nobr>, killing Keith Wright: <nobr>-2</nobr>, killing Chris Wright: <nobr>-1</nobr>
  </li></ul>

  The family which has the highest counter at the end of the game wins the power struggle; in case of a tie, the order of priority is: Mordino, Bishop, Salvatore, Wright. Usually this whole thing doesn't matter since you're killing the bosses of whatever families you don't like anyway.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The two "impregnation" endings take precedence over all others. Obviously they're only available for male characters.</blockquote>

  <h4>Richard Wright's murder</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Murder solved: Solve the murder quest correctly.
  </li><li>True murderer never found: Finger a suspect other than the Salvatores.
  </li></ol>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You always get ending 2 if you attack the Wrights at any time during the game, even if you never got the quest to begin with.</blockquote>

  <h4>Myron</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Myron dead and forgotten: Hear Myron's name from Jules, Little Jesus, Renesco, Reed or Myron himself, and don't have him killed during the game.
  </li></ol>

  <h4>Gecko</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Gecko destroyed: Blow up the power plant.
  </li><li>Gecko and Vault City form uneasy truce: Fix the power plant but don't get the Reactor Holodisk from Festus.
  </li><li>Gecko invaded by Vault City: Fix and optimize the power plant.
  </li></ol>

  There are two pictures for Gecko; both show the power plant, but for ending 3 the lights are on.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Note that you can fall between endings 2 and 3 and thus not get any ending for Gecko even though you fixed the plant. Rumours that ending 3 is triggered by giving the Gecko Holodisk to McClure and/or performing Stark's scouting mission around Gecko are incorrect. You always get it if you optimize the plant. The best ending for Gecko, which would require you to optimize the plant and get the Gecko Holodisk from Gordon after talking to the Brain, is impossible to get due to a silly bug in the endings script.</blockquote>

  <h4>Redding</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Redding annexed by Vault City: Deliver the Jet antidote, leave and return to downtown Redding at least one day later, and don't kill Dr Johnson (even after the cure is administered).
  </li><li>Redding in league with New Reno: Sell the chip to McGrew, don't get ending 1.
  </li><li>Redding in league with NCR: Sell the chip to LeBarge, don't get ending 1.
  </li><li>Redding deserted: Don't sell the chip, don't get ending 1.
  </li></ol>

  Redding has two pictures showing different mining equipment, one for endings 1-2 and one for endings 3-4.

  <h4>Broken Hills</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Mutants dead, BH disperses: Kill the mutants in the mine.
  </li><li>Uranium runs out, BH disperses: Get Marcus to put the mutant-haters in jail.
  </li><li>Racial wars erupt, BH disperses: Do neither of the above.
  </li></ol>

  <h4>New California Republic</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>NCR established: Complete the deal between NCR and Vault 15.
  </li><li>NCR expansion slowed: Don't complete the deal, don't kill Westin.
  </li><li>Carlson rules corruptly: Don't complete the deal, kill Westin but not Carlson.
  </li><li>NCR under military rule: Don't complete the deal, kill Westin and Carlson.
  </li></ol>

  The NCR has two pictures, both showing the flag; for endings 2-3 the flag is in tatters.

  <h4>Vault 15</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Vault 15 joins NCR: Complete the deal with NCR.
  </li><li>Vault 15 deserted: Don't complete the deal.
  </li></ol>

  Vault 15 has two pictures: for ending 1 it shows the "improved" V15 map as it looks in the game, while ending 2 has a proper picture of a shack in a barren desert (just like the place looked in <i>Fallout</i>, yay! None of that where-the-heck-did-that-come-from cliff wall stuff).

  <h4>Vault 13</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Genocide: Either kill Gruthar, or return to Vault 13 after the massacre.
  </li></ol>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You can avoid this ending (and so get none for Vault 13) if you don't trigger the massacre or if you don't return afterwards, but if you get it the game will always blame you for killing the deathclaws. This is reminiscent of the Hub and Followers ending problems in the original <i>Fallout</i>.</blockquote>

  <h4>San Francisco</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Population disperses after rampage: Turn the Shi hostile.
  </li><li>Sentient plant problems: Kill Dr Wong without turning the Shi hostile.
  </li><li>The Shi flourish: Don't turn the Shi hostile, don't kill Dr Wong.
  </li></ol>

  There are three SF pictures, all showing the arch by the town entrance; for ending 1 it's got cobwebs on it, for ending 2 it has lots of green vines (evil plant, brr), and for ending 3 it's festooned with lamps and vines.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Those Shi sure are sensitive. If you do everything normally in SF, then position yourself outside the tanker, toss a Plant Spike on one of the dockworkers and hurt him for 1 HP before ducking into the tanker and sailing off for the Enclave, you'll get the "demoralized and leaderless after your rampage" ending. I mean, it was a Plant Spike, get over it.</blockquote>

  <h4>Tanker vagrants</h4>

  <ol>
  <li>Vagrants move on: You always get this (even if you kill them).
  </li></ol>
  <hr>

  <a name="encounter"></a><h3>Encounters</h3>

  <blockquote>"Radscorpions? What's so rad about them?"<br>
  --New Reno comedian</blockquote>

  You'll notice the wasteland is full of critters and creeps who want your hide. When you run into an encounter on the world map, there's an Outdoorsman check to see if you may choose to avoid it. You end an encounter by running to the edge of the map, or, if you have the car, using it (even in the middle of combat). Running off the map will put you in the car if you have it.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  It seems that your effective Outdoorsman skill (chance of success <i>before</i> negative modifiers are applied) cannot exceed 95%, meaning there's no point in raising the skill beyond that, or carrying a Motion Sensor if you're already at that skill level.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The xp you gain from successful use of the Outdoorsman skill is equal to 100 plus the difficulty of the check (from 0 to 70 based on encounter zone, not encounter type) minus your skill level (capped at 95). If you're in the car you don't always get any xp, indicating it gives you an added independent chance (seemingly 50%) of avoiding encounters.</blockquote>

  Here's a list of beings you may stumble upon. This division of areas is very imprecise and they overlap vastly. Critters may appear in areas below the one where they are listed; especially mantis, wolves and radscorpions appear pretty much all over the map.<br><br>

  <b>Northwest</b> (Arroyo): scorpions, radscorpions, outcasts, fishermen (coast only), war party, hunting party, cannibals, wilders, hermit, rats, pig rats, nomads, silver geckos, holy people, ants, spore plants.<br><br>

  <b>North</b> (Klamath, Den, Modoc): highwaymen, golden geckos, mole rats, wild brahmin, slavers (and slaves), trappers, Den caravan, Vault City caravan, merchant and guards, farmers, homeless people, bandits, moonshiners, mantis, rave party, robbers.<br><br>

  <b>Northeast</b> (Vault City, Gecko): merchant party, wild dogs, ghoul crazies, patrol unit, mutated rats, mutated mole rats, mutated pig rats, ghoul scavengers, caravan.<br><br>

  <b>East</b> (Broken Hills, NCR): marauders, raiders, Rangers, caravan, Unity patrol, rogues.<br><br>

  <b>Central</b> (Redding, New Reno): yakuza, mobsters, gang, traveler, fire geckos, claim jumpers, homesteaders, prospectors, bootleggers, Redding caravan, wolves, New Reno caravan.<br><br>

  <b>South</b> (Military Base, Vault 13): remnants of the Master's army, deathclaws, NCR Rangers, caravan.<br><br>

  <b>Southwest</b> (Navarro, SF): floaters, centaurs, Enclave patrol, Hubologists, press gang, aliens, caravan, mercenaries.<br><br>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Some encounters come in the form of "X fending off Y", where X and Y are groups you would find in that area. In these cases, if you move out of the way you won't be attacked until they're finished with each other. Note that if you go into a cave and then come out again while this is going on, they'll forget that they were fighting, and normally hostile groups will then turn on you. In other encounters different groups work together, such as "raiders searching with wild dogs", "robbers and highwaymen" or "radscorpions hiding among spore plants". In some encounters where there are two separate groups (e.g. "aliens and deathclaws") you'll start out fighting one group, while the other will be idle and not react to your presence until combat ends (or you attack them). This will allow you to leave the map or position yourself before fighting the other group.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Don't drop important items on the ground in random encounter maps, because if you leave them there when you exit to the world map they're gone forever. This also goes for NPCs!</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Merchants may trade with you depending on the sign of your karma (some will dismiss you for being a do-gooder, others for being a meanie). Inventory depends on location: New Reno merchants will have lots of drugs, for example, and VC merchants will have lots of healing items. One caravan in the NCR-Vault 13 area is a good source of Scout Handbooks. Another in the SF area has a 10% chance of carrying the rare XL70E3 each time you meet them. Some other critters can be traded with as well (e.g. fishermen, hermits, farmers), though they have nothing of value. (There is actually 1 chance in 100 that a fisherman will carry a Laser Pistol; they'll offer to sell it for $10,000, which is of course much more than it's worth.)</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The traveler can put New Reno and Vault City on your world map.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  In the homeless people and farmers encounters there may be a critter that is using the male, bald "yellow pyjamas" model, but which counts as a child (you can tell from his floating dialogue), and killing him makes you a Childkiller.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  If you meet trappers, you can pimp Miria or Davin once to each trapper (regardless of gender) for one Gecko Pelt and one Golden Gecko Pelt if you don't have enough money to pay for them (drop your money first). If you're not married you can sleep with the trapper yourself, but you'll get poisoned. If you have IN&lt;4, each trapper you talk to will give you a Gecko Pelt. Stochastic adds: "When in dialogue with the trappers, if you have enough money to purchase a normal Gecko Pelt, but not enough to buy a Golden Gecko Pelt, you can purchase the golden pelts for free! This only works for the in-dialogue trading, not the formal barter interface."</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The rave party encounter found around the Den is extra rare because it happens only during certain hours (7 p.m. to midnight). You can actually get infinite chems in this encounter. There will be one or two people selling booze and a few others running around who sell Mentats, Buffout and Psycho. When you pay for a chem, your money goes into their inventory and they try to walk up to you and use a newly created chem dose on you. If you move away the chem will be left on the ground instead for you to pick up. When you're done, kill the partiers or just steal the money. You can also have sex with the partiers if you like. To do this you must first use a skill on them (Steal, First Aid or Doctor); this will give you an extra line of dialogue. Just ask them until they agree, and gender is not an object.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  As pointed out by Jon Lynch, some people in random encounters will let you steal freely from them, to wit: the hunting party, Hubologists, bootleggers and moonshiners.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The number of critters in an encounter depends to some extent on the size of your own party. For instance, Enclave patrols will usually consist of three soldiers if you have a party of 1-3 people, but can come in squads of seven if you have a full group. Volcano draws some evil conclusions: "I have found a use for all of the useless NPCs. When I am trying to level up and acquire loot by fighting Enclave patrols, I prefer to leave my good NPCs behind. Otherwise, they end up taking a lot of damage, and take a lot of time or Stimpaks to heal up again. The problem is, when you are alone you find almost exclusively three-man patrols. Taking along a disposable NPC lets you encounter more big patrols."</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The best place to level up late in the game is the strip of desert between San Francisco and New Reno. Good xp encounters include tough aliens, deathclaws, floaters and centaurs (particularly the last ones are easy), but avoid those pesky fire geckos.</blockquote>

  If your karma drops really low (<nobr>-501</nobr>, although the wanted posters will appear at <nobr>-500</nobr>) or if you count as a Childkiller, you'll sometimes run into bounty hunters. The minimum number in a group is two, and the maximum number is four, plus one if they're after you for killing kids, plus one if you're level 19 or more. Their toughness and equipment will depend on your level (with variations within each group):

  <ul>
  <li>1-6: Leather jacket, Hunting Rifle, Desert Eagle.
  </li><li>7-12: Leather armour, Assault Rifle, Super Sledge, Sniper Rifle.
  </li><li>13-18: Combat armour, Laser Rifle, Frag Grenades, Power Fist.
  </li><li>19-99: Power armour, Gauss Rifle, Plasma Grenades, Avenger Minigun.
  </li></ul>

  Needless to say this can be a pain, as especially the later encounters are much more dangerous than the xp reward warrants. You get <nobr>-10</nobr> karma for each bounty hunter you kill, so that would seem like something of a downward spiral. If you're only wanted because of your karma you can make the wanted posters disappear by climbing above <nobr>-501</nobr> again.<br><br>

  And now for some overly detailed data on... the Mysterious Stranger! If you for some reason got this perk, the chance that he or she will show up in an encounter is equal to 30+LK*2 out of 100. Their HP and armour state (though they will always have the leather jacket look) depend on your level as follows:

  <ul>
  <li>9-14: 50 HP, leather armour.
  </li><li>15-18: 70 HP, combat leather jacket.
  </li><li>19-22: 90 HP, metal armour mk II.
  </li><li>23-26: 110 HP, combat armour mk II.
  </li><li>27-99: 130 HP, power armour.
  </li></ul>

  The female 9-14 variety has 2 HP more than the male, i.e. 52 (ooh). Their weapon changes as follows (in each encounter they will have one of the weapons listed):

  <ul>
  <li>9-13: Hunting Rifle, FN FAL.
  </li><li>14-19: Assault Rifle, Combat Shotgun.
  </li><li>20-26: Laser Rifle, H&amp;K CAWS.
  </li><li>27-99: H&amp;K G11.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The Mysterious Stranger can be exploited for infinite ammo. Whenever you enter an empty spot on the world map there's a chance that the stranger is standing nearby. Use Steal to get some ammo and Stimpaks. If you get caught, nothing happens. After you steal their stuff, enter combat and spend a round just running around. When combat ends they'll start moving away, but if you quickly save then load the game they'll stop. Steal again - new ammo. If they manage to get away you can just leave the map and repeat the whole thing. Also, on some random maps after combat is over the stranger doesn't quite get off the map when running away from you afterwards (works on some mountain maps), meaning if you position yourself correctly you can steal and enter combat repeatedly without having to worry about them getting away. You can get plenty of Micro Fusion Cell or 4.7mm Caseless ammo doing this. Finally there's a comparatively minor bug: a stranger carrying a Hunting Rifle will have Shotgun Shells, not .223 FMJ.</blockquote>

  In many mountain encounters you'll find a cave opening which you can go through. (There's also one treeless map with a cave opening but no actual cave.) Most often you'll find varying quantities of radscorpions, mole rats, geckos or deathclaws, which are generally not worth taking on, but once in a great while you may come across a cave full of human robbers (the chance is 1 in 13 for each cave, plus you must also pass a Luck check; if you find a completely empty cave you'll know you failed the check). These come in different varieties depending on your level:

  <ul>
  <li>1-5: Leather armour (jacket look), 10mm Pistol, 10mm SMG, Spear.
  </li><li>6-10: Leather armour, Scoped Hunting Rifle, Desert Eagle, Plated Boxing Gloves (!).
  </li><li>11-14: Combat armour, Power Fist, Super Cattle Prod, .223 Pistol, HK P90c.
  </li><li>15-99: Combat armour, Pulse Rifle, FN FAL, H&amp;K G11E, Turbo Plasma Rifle.
  </li></ul>

  Many of them carry a lot of ammo. Very worthwhile and not too difficult if you bring friends. Each such cave also comes with three chests full of money and more loot like Stimpaks and grenades; if you're lucky you can find a Super Sledge from level 6, a Power Fist from level 8 or a Plasma Rifle from level 11.<br><br>

  Apart from general random encounters, there are also special, one-time encounters which often have some kind of humourous twist. It's not exactly known how it's decided how often you get them; Luck, Perception and Outdoorsman are the usual suspects (used to be LK in <i>Fallout</i>, so it's a pretty good bet). Game difficulty also seems to affect this; it'll take significantly longer to find all encounters if you play on hard. There are two kinds of special encounter: those that leave a permanent location on your world map, and those that don't. The first kind will bring up a green circle which is marked "Unknown" at first, the second will just flash a red circle and leave no mark on your world map (so don't drop any items there). The latter kind is identified with the word "red" in the list below.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  If you decline to enter a special encounter when you first find it, you may come across it again (because the encounter is only flagged as found when you enter the map), but it will have to be in another encounter zone (because the encounter script has a memory of its own). This is also true for encounters with map locations; these will remain on the map marked "Unknown" after you first get them, and are relocated when you run into the encounter again somewhere else. The Cafe is the only one that moves around even when it's been identified, because of a bug.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  In rare cases a special encounter may not leave a location on the world map even though it usually would.</blockquote>

  For each special encounter there's a minimum level to get it, also given in parentheses below. What special encounters you find will depend on the terrain you're in: all special encounters occur in desert areas except for the Bridge which is a mountain encounter, while coast and city areas have no special encounters at all. The Bridge also has the highest relative probability of popping up, so it's usually your first one in any game.<br><br>

  There's another way in which special encounters distinguish themselves, namely by being "good" or "bad". It does seem, however, that the game itself makes no such distinction, so that perks that raise the probability of finding special encounters will reap you unpleasant ones as well as the beneficial kind. In any case you will find all special encounters regardless of your stats if you just keep playing long enough.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  There are a few encounters where the map will reset every time you enter it, so dropped items will be lost. These are the Guardian Portal and all three "bad" encounters. They also share the feature that when you leave the area for the first time it remains labelled "Unknown". To make its proper name appear on the world map, simply enter and exit the encounter again (I wouldn't do this for the Toxic waste dump, though!).</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You can't leave your car on a special encounter map unless it is out of fuel, but in that case it will appear properly even on the "resetting" maps.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Often you'll see a single Rock lying on the ground of most of the special encounter maps (to my knowledge, all special encounters but the Cafe of Broken Dreams, plus the Bess encounter). I can't help feeling there is some significance to this. Since the Rocks are randomly placed they can end up on exit grids or behind opaque scenery where you can't get them.</blockquote>

  Good encounters include:<br><br>

  <b>A Guardian Portal (8):</b> (Guardian of Forever) You encounter a large stone ring (reference to the Star Trek episode "City on the Edge of Forever"). Walk into it and you'll end up on level 3 of Vault 13 some 80 years ago. Grab the equipment in the lockers and chests, and take the Solar Scorcher from the floor in the armoury. When you're tired of the place, use the beeping computer with the water chip, breaking it for 1000 xp and returning to the stone ring which is now inert.<br><br>

  <b>A man guarding a bridge (10):</b> (Bridge) You come across a chasm, spanned by a bridge guarded by a robed figure (reference to Monty Python's <i>The Quest for the Holy Grail</i>). For some reason, the only exit grid (and your car!) is on the other side. Talk to the guy and he'll ask you first two straightforward questions and then a game-related trivia question (save and reload if you want to see all the trivia questions, there are three of them). If you answer any question incorrectly, you die. If you answer all questions correctly, he grumbles and leaves. If you answer the final question with a counter-question (Ã  la <i>Holy Grail</i>), he dies instead and you gain 500 xp. Funny. Take his Bridgekeeper's Robes, which has the same stats as Combat Armor except that it has no radiation protection and weighs less (and makes you look stupid, so I'd give it to a party member). Should you attack the bridgekeeper, he'll summon up an endless swarm of exploding brahmin that will make things difficult for you. You gain 7500 combat xp for killing him, which must be accomplished by inflicting critical hits as he's nearly impervious to harm (it's possible to get him with an instant kill critical, so if you have Better Criticals and are able to keep off the cows, go for it). If you regret attacking him you can avoid the cow or let it explode and then talk to the bridgekeeper.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The summoned cows work like the ones in the mad brahmin encounter (see below). The bridgekeeper will only produce a new cow (ending combat in the process) when an existing one is killed, so you can enter combat mode and ignore the non-exploding brahmin until you've dealt with the guardian. You may want to set any NPCs to attack the strongest target.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
  There's a general engine bug that you may be most likely to take note of here, though it has also been observed with Enclave troops and the pariah dog. Whenever you off a critter with an instant death critical hit that does no damage, the kill doesn't completely register. As a result you get no xp for that critter, death variables will not be set and so on. In the case of the bridgekeeper this means you'll miss out on the 7500 xp if you kill him with such a hit before you wear down his Hit Points. However, there is a sure-fire way to avoid this. The Living Anatomy perk adds 5 points of damage after Damage Resistance is applied, meaning you will never score 0-damage kills against living targets like the bridgekeeper. I knew there was a reason why I like that one.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  IN&lt;4: The conversation will be a bit different. You'll only be able to ask him a question (what his name is) when he asks your name, after that you only get a "wrong" answer and a "correct" answer (both are gibberish, so you may not know which is which).</blockquote>

  <b>A giant stone head (10):</b> (Talking Head) You find a big monument head, talking to itself. It's actually the Sacred Head of the Vault Dweller. Listen to it for a while if you like, then use the hand icon to initiate dialogue and listen to what's being said. After a while, you'll have gained a Monument Chunk which, when used, gives you ST +3, AG +3 and Damage Resistance +50. Temporarily, of course. This is exactly the kind of item you end up never using at all. You can skip to the end of the conversation by resting 12 hours with your Pipboy.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You can get 3 more Monument Chunks by using Steal on the head. If you have Steal tagged or at 95% or above you can pick them up with ease, but otherwise you'll be instantly slain, even if you don't take anything!</blockquote>

  <b>A tin woodsman (6, red):</b> There's a guy in power armour who can't move. Pick up the oil can right next to him and use it on him for a reward of 150 Micro Fusion Cell. If you kill him (easy, since he can't do anything) he has nothing on him.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  To my knowledge the Cola Fridge furniture object inside the house (and possibly that particular Stove as well) cannot be found anyplace else. But they don't actually do anything.</blockquote>

  <b>The Cafe of Broken Dreams (1):</b> (Cafe of Broken Dreams) You come across a strange establishment. The layout of the buildings is uncannily familiar! Make sure you listen to what everyone here has to say (talk to them to speed up their monologues). Dogmeat, the old mutt, will join your party if you remove any armour you're wearing so that your vault suit shows, or if you're wearing the Bridgekeeper's Robes (bug).

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  There is another, not so good way of recruiting Dogmeat: using an Iguana-on-a-stick on him (conveniently one is lying around in one of the rooms). So why is this bad? Well, most of the time it causes my game to crash, that's why. Since the vault suit thing is quick and easy, this should not be a problem.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  This encounter is unique in the way that it can only be found in the central and southern parts of the world map, while the others can be found anywhere.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  The reason why the Cafe effectively has a minimum level of 1 (it should really have been 6) is the same bug responsible for its repopping. Incidentally, this bug cancels out another bug (that the script checks the wrong variable, just as for the second hand grenade encounter) which would otherwise have made this encounter impossible to get in many games. See Addenda for a way to fix both of these bugs at the same time.</blockquote>

  <b>The Unwashed Villagers hunting a spammer (6, red):</b> This is a reference to a <i>Fallout</i> Internet community and a real incident with a troll. Actually I don't like the way they gang up on the poor spammer, so I just kill them all if I can. So sorry, Internet community. Also they have about 600 rounds of 10mm JHP on them, which could come in handy. There are 6 Stimpaks and a Fruit in a nearby locker. If you do nothing, the villagers kill the spammer and run off the map. If the spammer lives to the end of the battle, he'll just walk around spouting stupid comments.<br><br>

  <b>A crashed shuttle (6):</b> (Federation Shuttle) Looks like a crashed shuttle from the USS <i>Torres</i> (a shame it wasn't a <i>Voyager</i> shuttle, since that's the only starship in known space which is profoundly unaffected by the loss of either shuttles or crew members). Search the bodies for 3 Hypos, which will each restore 75-100 Hit Points when used. Pretty good.<br><br>

  <b>King Arthur's Knights (10, red):</b> You meet a contingent of heavily armed Brotherhood warriors in some old ruins. They'll ask you if you've seen the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, and if you say yes and point in a random direction you get $500 for your trouble. Then you ask them about the G.E.C.K., and they'll point in a similar direction. Then they move off the map. You can kill them (tough), but they don't have anything special on them (you only get one weapon, a Gatling Laser).

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  It is perhaps only to be expected that there have been persistent Internet rumours that the Holy Hand Grenade can actually be found in the game. This is not true, but see the Addenda section for more information.</blockquote>

  Pointless encounters include:<br><br>

  <b>The remains of a whale (6):</b> (Crashed Whale) You find a whale smashed to pieces (a reference to <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>). Nearby is a useless pot of Daisies which is part of the joke. This seems to be the only encounter that doesn't have any potential beneficial or harmful effect. Possibly the Daisies was one of the many things they had something in mind for but ultimately didn't have time to finish.<br><br>

  Bad encounters include:<br><br>

  <b>A lone surviving dog (6):</b> (Pariahs) You find an area strewn with corpses. Guess they got unlucky somehow. Hanging around is a strange dog... who'll start following you if you fail a LK check (there's a new one every 10 seconds). This is the pariah dog, who will give you a Jinxed special perk (I can only assume that it does the same thing as the trait; whether they are cumulative is anyone's guess), and lower your Luck to 1. What's more, the dog takes up one of your NPC slots. Yipes! To get rid of the dog you must kill it, and it has 750 HP. If you can't afford to waste the ammo, but have access to the Sierra Army Depot, go to the second level there and put the dog on the electric floor. Die, mongrel, die! If you're evil you can take the dog to the organ extraction chamber and use it twice on the dog to kill it (which will net you 2 Human Brains (!) and <nobr>-200</nobr> karma). If you kill the dog your LK returns to normal, you lose the Jinxed perk, and the dog will show up again on the Pariahs map (this is probably a bug).

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star4.gif" alt="a yellow star" align="left">
  Some would say this encounter isn't so bad, because there's a bug you may be able to exploit to raise your Luck. There are no guarantees, but this is pretty much how it works: 1) The bug doesn't have anything to do with being able to find the pariah dog in the first place, or how to approach/kill it, rather it's related to how the game keeps track of and modifies (or fails to modify) your stats. 2) To profit from the bug your original Luck must have been 5 or less. If it was 5 you must not have increased it to more than 6 (i.e. by taking the Gain Luck perk or the SF zeta scan), but raising your Luck from 4 to 7 <i>does</i> allow you to gain more Luck. 3) The bug triggers when your Luck has been raised from its initial value by getting Gain Luck and/or a zeta scan before the dog joins you. Although you get the Jinxed perk your Luck doesn't go to 1, and when you kill the dog your LK increases above its current value. 4) The increase in Luck is equal to your current LK minus one; e.g. it will go from 4 to 7, or from 6 or more to 10. 5) If your original Luck was 6 or higher the first part of the bug may still trigger - not losing any Luck - but you don't gain anything, either. 6) Returning to pick the dog up and kill it again works just the same, with your improved Luck as your new "original" value. 7) If you have the Gifted trait, all of the above will proceed as if your Luck was 1 lower, i.e. your original LK must be 6 or less, and it will become 2 when the dog is with you. This also means that using Mutate! to get Gifted and increase your Luck that way is not a valid trigger for the bug. The best way to go about exploiting this bug would probably be to start with LK 4, play until you run into the dog (making sure you don't get to level 12 first and miss out on getting Better Criticals at level 9), give it the slip and get the zeta scan in NCR, then return to the dog and raise your LK to 10. A slightly more complicated plan would be to start with LK 1, get the zeta scan and let the dog raise it to 5, then get Gain Luck and trigger the bug again for LK 10 - basically you get three stat points in exchange for one perk, but this interferes with getting Better Criticals.</blockquote>

  <b>Toxic waste dump (6):</b> This area is full of patches of green radioactive goo, with geckos of all kinds moving everywhere. There's nothing else except that you get hit with a massive dose of radiation even before geckos start breathing fire on you from all directions. Not so good. The exit grid is on the right in case you don't want to reload right away.<br><br>

  <b>A herd of brahmin (6):</b> (Mad Brahmin) Brahmin come walking towards you; when they're close enough, they explode, and new ones materialize. Just get out of there before your party members start dying.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  An observation by Nevill: "Mad brahmin do not explode in combat mode - they only butt the player for an insignificant amount of damage. Also the mad brahmin that spawn in combat mode after the first ones are killed do absolutely nothing until the end of combat."</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Never save in this encounter; the save may be corrupted and unloadable.</blockquote>

  Other encounters include:<br><br>

  <b>A trader and guards:</b> Go to the top of the map directly north of Modoc and walk around that block and the area extending roughly two squares in all directions. Eventually you'll get this encounter. Turns out there's a trader named Willy who wants to sell something. Problem is, while talking to him you fall asleep, and must then choose if you want to buy a weapon without knowing exactly what it is. The solution? Use Steal on him before talking to him, or just hit the barter button in dialogue, and you'll see what the item is (he'll have 1-5 of them). What weapons he might be carrying depends on your level:

  <ul>
  <li>1+: Sharpened Spear, Spiked Knuckles
  </li><li>1-3: Knife, Rock, Spear
  </li><li>1-5: Throwing Knife, 10mm Pistol, Crowbar, Club, Brass Knuckles, Red Ryder BB Gun
  </li><li>1-10: Sharpened Pole
  </li><li>3-5: Combat Knife, Desert Eagle .44, Shotgun, Hunting Rifle
  </li><li>6-10: 10mm SMG
  </li><li>6+: 14mm Pistol, Cattle Prod
  </li><li>8+: Ripper
  </li><li>10+: Power Fist
  </li><li>11-15: Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle
  </li><li>13+: Alien Blaster
  </li><li>15-20: Minigun
  </li></ul>

  The script picks one of these weapons at random and then checks to see if you match the level requirement. If the Alien Blaster was picked you must also pass a Luck check or the result is re-rolled. The price Willy asks in dialogue is the weapon's usual barter value (excluding ammo) multiplied by (<nobr>11-LK</nobr>), meaning he'll ask $10,000 for the Blaster if you have Luck 10. You may be able to get a better price just by hitting barter. As an additional curiosity his male guards all carry 9mm Mausers, a rare weapon. This encounter will happen any number of times, and you can kill Willy and his guards and still get the same encounter again.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  It's possible in this area to get the encounter "A merchant with some guards" which is just your random trader who won't barter with characters of good karma, but the two groups of people look almost identical. Don't get the encounters mixed up.</blockquote>

  <b>Some people in the wrong place at the wrong time:</b> This one is timed to happen on 30 Aug 2241 or thereafter. You'll witness three menacing figures with miniguns mowing down some people. Just a little bit of foreshadowing. There's nothing on the corpses.<br><br>

  <b>A band of ruffians led by a Morton brother:</b> You get these after doing quest 1 in Redding. Ordinary battles. Toad is harmless, Newt has a Light Support Weapon, and Snake has a H&amp;K G11E. If you choose to avoid a Morton encounter, or run from it without killing the brother, he'll be back later on.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  This encounter suffers from the bug that the brother and his thugs aren't on the same team, so if the brother starts combat the thugs won't attack until you've finished him off (assuming you don't attack them first), and vice versa. You can even get them to fight one another.</blockquote>

  <b>A herd of brahmin:</b> If you travel near Modoc after freeing Bess and the other brahmin, you may find several dead brahmin lying about. Oh well.<br><br><hr>

  <a name="npc"></a><h3>NPCs</h3>

  <blockquote>"Wow! I feel as if I've passed some arbitrary experience value and gained more power!"<br>
  --Marcus</blockquote>

  NPCs or non-player characters are people you pick up during your travels to fight and die for you, and to carry stuff. Equip them with the best armour and/or weapons they can use which you're not using yourself, and let them carry a bunch of Stimpaks for healing.<br><br>

  If you tell them to heal themselves, or if they decide that's a good idea anyway, they'll use items or skills in this order of preference: Super Stimpak, Stimpak, Healing Powder, Doctor's Bag, First Aid Kit, then whichever healing skill they're best at, which is First Aid for everyone except Lenny (First Aid heals 5-15 HP in this case, Doctor 10-25 HP). If they use a skill this counts towards your own limit. If they're holding a weapon you may have to leave dialogue before they can do any healing, because they have to do the putting away animation.<br><br>

  NPCs can equip any weapon for which they have animation frames (listed below). This means Sulik can use a Super Sledge but never a Cattle Prod, Marcus is the only one who can use miniguns and large energy weapons, and so on. Also everyone has the basic unarmed animation. That they can equip a weapon does <i>not</i> guarantee they are proficient with it, i.e. you can give Lenny the Alien Blaster since it uses the handgun animation, but he can't hit anything since he can't handle Energy Weapons, and Marcus can toss grenades though he doesn't really have the Throwing skill. Note that an NPC won't equip a weapon for which they carry no ammo, even if they can use it, and won't equip a weapon that doesn't suit their current combat settings.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  A few weapons use animations that aren't too obvious: the 14mm Pistol and .223 Pistol use the SMG animation, and the Tommy Gun uses the rifle animation instead of SMG.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The "throw" animation is used for Grenades, Rocks, Flares and such; Spears and Throwing Knives use the animation frames of those weapons when thrown. Note that an NPC can only use grenades if their weapon preference is set to "None", which prevents Sulik and Lenny from using such weapons even though they have the animations.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  A weird thing you can do is to equip an NPC with a lit Flare. Make sure they have no other weapon, light the Flare, give it to them and make them ready it. They will effectively become a light source, and what's more, this effect stays indefinitely even after the Flare has disappeared. You can do this for everyone who can equip Flares, i.e. Vic, Davin, Marcus and Myron. You can probably guess that it looks <i>very</i> odd to have them all running around in a big group at night. You can set Marcus to close combat mode and let him rush forward to illuminate your enemies at night, although this should be marginally useful at best. You can actually do this with your own character, but the effect wears off when you switch maps.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You should make a habit of entering the custom combat settings for each NPC as you find them, so that they conform to your strategy and preferences as well as whatever weaponry you have provided them with.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  NPCs never get radiated or poisoned. They will suffer normal after-effects from chems, though (like losing ST from Buffout or AP from Jet), and not only can they get addicted, but they can seemingly have multiple concurrent and cumulative withdrawal effects. In the case of most chems you can wait this out, but Jet addiction is permanent and the Jet Antidote doesn't work on NPCs, so you risk reducing them to wrecks with just one or a few AP. Furthermore, levelling up will interact oddly with drug use, since their current stats change without regard for temporary effects. An NPC levelling up with raised stats will have the appropriate penalties applied to his new stats, ending up below his proper values. Conversely, an NPC levelling up while in the state of short- or long-term withdrawal will effectively receive a lasting boost when the withdrawal wears off. In either case, the next level up (if there is one) will return things to normal.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  If an NPC dies, and you then save and load the game or leave the map and return, the body will be gone and any carried equipment gone with it (unless they had already dropped it as a result of being fried or blown up). This happens even before you recruit them. Also beware that if an NPC dies and you save the game while still in combat mode, loading that save invariably seems to freeze the game badly at end of turn.</blockquote>

  NPCs in your party won't turn on you if you accidentally hit them in combat (although this could happen in the unpatched game, leading among other things to the "apathetic Vic" bug). However, should ever a party member happen to hit a neutral or "friendly" critter (unless they have a green outline), or should an ally accidentally hit a party member, you'll soon have a fight on your hands you might not like. Another reason to save often, folks.<br><br>

  If an NPC gets hurt by an explosive charge placed by you, they'll attack you for one round and then drop it. If you attack an NPC that's not currently in your party, they'll fight back. Whether you can recruit them again after running from the fight depends on their script. NPCs fall into roughly four categories: those who will be peaceful if you leave and return (Laddie, Robodog); those who will be peaceful after you let them initiate combat once, leave and return (Sulik, Lenny, K-9); those who carry a grudge but can be recruited if you manage to talk to them before they can attack (Cassidy); and those who will in most cases turn permanently hostile or incommunicable (Vic, Marcus, Myron, Goris, Dogmeat). The Brain Bot is a special case since it won't turn hostile at all if shot at, but will turn permanently hostile if stolen from. Also depending on script and location surrounding critters may turn permanently hostile, too - this happens if you attack Sulik in downtown Klamath or Lenny anywhere in Gecko.<br><br>

  Most NPCs belong to local teams before you recruit them and after being dropped off in their home locations, and will attack you if you fight people there; this goes for Sulik, the Modoc NPCs, Lenny, Marcus, Robodog and Goris. Except for Marcus and the Modoc NPCs they won't turn hostile as long as you don't attack them directly, though depending on the circumstances it may be difficult to recruit them later.<br><br>

  You can barter freely with NPCs, or use the Steal interface for quicker access (all attempts to steal or plant items will be successful). Make sure you don't try to steal from an NPC not currently in your party, though, since if you fail this will generally have the same effect as attacking them.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Beware that if you access the inventory of some party members while they're unconscious, this will have the same effect as stealing from them while they're not in your party, although they still remain with you. Notably, Vic and Myron will refuse to communicate from that point, reducing their usefulness, and Goris will turn permanently hostile once you dismiss him from your service. In v1.0 this could apparently also trigger from friendly fire (the patch notes state NPCs will not turn hostile "under most circumstances").</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  There is a glitch or oversight you can take advantage of to make NPCs act as mules in an almost <i>Fallout</i>-like fashion. Matt Sampson: "I've found a method to give NPCs infinite carrying capacity, at the expense of a little less than half their Action Points. First you tell your comrades to wait for you. Then you go into barter and trade the stuff to them like you normally do. You will notice that instead of evaluating the goods by their weight, your NPCs evaluate the goods by price. Thus, you can weigh them down with whatever goods you like. I believe I once gave Vic 800 pounds of gear." Note that if you give them really much (more than you can unload in one bartering session) you'll have to get their stuff by using Steal.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Sometimes after trading equipment to NPCs you may find that they exceed their Carry Weight allowance unexpectedly. The reason for this is that on occasion they reload weapons in their inventory that they're not using, which because of the way ammo weight is calculated will cause their total weight carried to go up (also see below for how they can actually increase the amount of ammo in their possession). If you find this excruciatingly annoying, always give them one or a few pounds less to carry than what the combat screen reports they can take.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  There's an infinite ammo bug found by Raymond Schulz: Give two or more guns of the same type to an NPC who can use them, making sure that none is loaded and that there's some ammo available. When you press "use best weapon", all of the guns will be loaded using the same ammo! Unequip the wielded weapon, empty them all and repeat. Only one ammo "item" or fraction thereof will be used, e.g. if you do the trick with Cassidy, a BB Gun and a big heap of BB's, no more than 20 will go into each rifle. Something similar will happen when NPCs reload guns in combat; for instance, after equipping a 10mm SMG, reloading and firing a burst, Sulik carried a bunch of SMGs that were each just one bullet short of a full clip, while the weapon he had fired was somehow fully loaded.</blockquote>

  NPC levelling works like this: every time you level up, then for each NPC currently in your party who hasn't levelled up lately there is a chance that that NPC will gain a level. If they don't, the probability will be higher next time, so it's no big deal. If you want to, you can save before levelling up and do it many times to get a good result, but there's no guarantee that any specific NPC will even have the possibility of levelling up. Note that they don't have to be with you when you earn xp, only at the specific moment when you level up.<br><br>

  Most NPCs can level up four or five times during a game. Each time he (for they are all male, or robots) will gain some Hit Points, Action Points, Carry Weight and combat prowess in a non-random fashion. Most of them also gain Critical Chance, Melee Damage and/or Sequence, though Lenny and Myron are exceptions. Check your NPC's combat screen for details. NPCs that cannot carry armour may also gain - or lose! - innate toughness. AC given in the list below is excluding the base AC (equal to their Agility) so that you can compare with normal armour stats; the numbers within parentheses denote levels.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Make sure you read your NPCs' comments as they level up. They range from bland early on to hilarious on the higher levels - Marcus and Myron have some priceless lines.</blockquote>

  Certain NPCs (Vic, Lenny, Myron) will use their special non-combat skill if you try to use that skill on something you're not standing right next to, and as long as their skill level is greater than yours. This way you can get Lenny to heal people using Doctor (though strangely this counts towards your own 3-times-a-day limit), or have Vic disable forcefields. There usually isn't much use for this. You can only have them perform actions using the skilldex, so you can't use Myron to hack computers or get the Cybernetic Brain, for instance.<br><br>

  If an NPC has a higher Outdoorsman value than yours it will be used automatically while travelling. This will probably only make a slight difference if any: the only one of them who has a significant skill level is Sulik, who reaches 80% at his highest level. Keeping a Motion Sensor in your own inventory will automatically apply its bonus to the party member with the highest skill (it does nothing if it's in the inventory of an NPC).<br><br>

  The various NPCs are:<br><br>

  <b>Sulik:</b> Found in Klamath. Your first NPC, and he should be with you all the way. Sulik can "consult the spirits" and sometimes provide you with extremely vague clues depending on location, but nothing I would pore over for too long.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Melee Weapons.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Small Guns, Unarmed, Throwing, Outdoorsman.
  </li><li>Animations: Knife, sledgehammer, spear, SMG.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 85, 93, 103, 113, 123, 134.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Take his Sledgehammer away and replace it with a Sharpened Spear or Combat Knife at first (this is because he seems to prefer the slow Sledgehammer attack and so only gets one attack per round, as opposed to two with a spear or three with a knife). Upgrade to 10mm SMG by the Den or Vault City, upgrade to HK P90c or (Mega) Power Fist in NCR/Vault 15, give him a H&amp;K G11E once you have enough Caseless ammo (i.e. once you reach San Francisco). If you want a safer gun-toting Sulik, give him a .223 Pistol. Of course he can also use the Super Sledge if you want him to bash people away so you can shoot them.
  </li></ul>

  <b>Vic:</b> Found in the Den. He's not as fun as Sulik or Cassidy, but well worth keeping. He's quite useful with a Gauss Rifle later on. After you've had him in your party for a while, you get a special dialogue option to tell him not to call you "Boss". Note that there's no typo in the HP list below; he really does have 78 HP for two levels.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Repair.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Small Guns, Energy Weapons (high levels).
  </li><li>Animations: Throw, knife, pistol, rifle.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 70, 78, 78, 102, 111, 117.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: 10mm Pistol or Hunting Rifle at first, then Combat Shotgun by Vault City, Sniper Rifle or Pancor Jackhammer when you find them, eventually Gauss Rifle (once you reach SF). At the two highest levels he can also use a Pulse Pistol or Alien Blaster well if you want him to. Since his ST is 5 before his last two levels you may want to avoid giving him a H&amp;K CAWS before then (the Gauss Rifle also has a min ST of 6, but it's so darn accurate anyway).
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Will attack you if you attack his daughter Valerie in Vault City while he's in your party (but not if he's currently out of it, even if you kill her before his very eyes).</blockquote>

  <b>Miria:</b> From Modoc. You really shouldn't touch her. Note that Miria and Davin don't have <i>any</i> skills, they just default to Unarmed since that skill has the highest base value.

  <ul>
  <li>Skill: Unarmed.
  </li><li>Animations: Knife, SMG.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 35 (does not level up).
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 7.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Sucks with anything. You can give her a 10mm SMG or even a Power Fist, but that's basically a waste of ammo. Her ST 3 won't let her use any SMG without a penalty.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Will attack you if you fight anyone in Modoc. Cannot be dropped off.</blockquote>

  <b>Davin:</b> See Miria.

  <ul>
  <li>Skill: Unarmed.
  </li><li>Animations: Throw, knife, club, pistol.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 35 (does not level up).
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 7.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Same as for Miria, although having ST 4 and different animations means he sucks with a wider and different assortment of weapons.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">

  <b>Laddie:</b> Jonny's dog in Modoc.

  <li>Skill: Unarmed.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 20 (does not level up).
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 7.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: None.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Will join you over the party limit at any time unless Jonny has been rescued, and unless Laddie has gone into woofing mode (see Modoc quest 4).

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Joshua Jansen points out that dog NPCs cannot open doors. I don't think there are any deeper applications for this in <i>Fallout 2</i>, but there you have it.</blockquote>

  <b>Cassidy:</b> Found in Vault City. Quite possibly your best choice. Very good with a rifle, but a good HtH fighter as well.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Small Guns.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Energy Weapons, Unarmed, Melee Weapons, Throwing.
  </li><li>Animations: Spear, pistol, rifle.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 80, 92, 104, 116, 128.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 8, 8, 9, 9, 10.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Same as for Vic: his Sawed-Off Shotgun or a Hunting Rifle at first, then Combat Shotgun, Sniper Rifle or better shotguns when you find them, eventually the Gauss Rifle (once you reach SF). Like Vic he can also make use of energy pistols. Spiked Knuckles and then Mega Power Fist in an HtH party.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Don't give him Psycho, Buffout or Jet, because of his heart condition (he'll die on you). All other drugs are fine including Super Stimpaks. Contrary to what Internet rumours say, the Heart Pills have nothing to do with Cassidy.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Cassidy will not join you if you are a Slaver or Childkiller or have karma <nobr>-101</nobr> or lower, but he doesn't leave if he's already in your party when you acquire these traits.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Two bugs regarding Cassidy have been reported. One makes his combat settings reset regularly, which is actually pretty annoying. Another is that his skill switches to Melee Weapons if you equip him with Power Armor, only to switch back after he gains a level. The latter is not a bug, as explained by Geoffrey Bateman: "For the first two levels, Cassidy's Small Guns skill is less than 6 points higher than his Unarmed and Melee skills, which means that the ST +3 bonus from Power Armor would boost those skills past Small Guns and make one of them his speciality. That's why it disappears as he gains levels."</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Cassidy has some of the coolest combat taunts in the game... for he will sometimes recite combat messages from <i>Wasteland</i> ("ground round", "thin red paste", "undertaker's nightmare").</blockquote>

  <b>Lenny:</b> Found in Gecko. Lenny is perhaps useful for a pack rat but not much more. Take him only if you favour large parties.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Doctor.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Small Guns.
  </li><li>Animations: Knife, pistol, SMG.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 129, 154, 181, 206.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 7, 7, 7, 7.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Some kind of pistol with a ST requirement of 4, like the Desert Eagle. Maybe a 10mm SMG and then a HK P90c if you're not worried about him spraying you. If you keep him long enough to get him in Power Armor you can give him a .223 Pistol or a H&amp;K G11E, assuming you don't have a Gauss Pistol to spare.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Lenny will leave if you acquire the Childkiller or Slaver reputations, have karma <nobr>-101</nobr> or lower, or have CH 1. Will attack you if you are in Gecko and have disabled the plant or turned the ghouls hostile. Won't rejoin you if your town reputation in Gecko is Hated or worse (e.g. if you blew up the plant or killed several ghouls, but killing only one or two is OK).</blockquote>

  <b>Marcus:</b> Found in Broken Hills, Marcus is a mixed blessing. On the one hand he's big, carries a lot, and makes things go boom in the night... On the other hand, he's slow, he can't wear armour and he favours weaponry that kills party members.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Big Guns.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Energy Weapons, Unarmed.
  </li><li>Animations: Throw, large rifle, minigun, rocket launcher.
  </li><li>AC/DT/DR: 20/4/30 (1), 10/4/30 (2-4), 20/5/40 (5-6).
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 130, 145, 165, 175, 190, 205.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: Minigun at first, perhaps Bozar if you find it and like to scrape other party members off walls, Turbo Plasma Rifle as soon as possible. Pulse Rifle even later on. Mega Power Fist works well if he doesn't get himself killed charging ahead.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Initially won't join you if your karma is below 0. Won't rejoin if your karma is <nobr>-101</nobr> or lower or you're a Slaver or Childkiller. Will attack you if you're an enemy of Broken Hills and Marcus is not in your party (and unlike Sulik and Lenny you don't have to be in Broken Hills for him to attack). Attacking Marcus when he's not in your party will turn Broken Hills hostile no matter where you do it.</blockquote>

  <b>Myron:</b> You should pick up Myron to initiate the Jet quest, then leave him somewhere. His primary use is to make chems. Let him do this for all of the ingredients you happen to be carrying (he checks both his own and your inventory) before you dump him somewhere accessible (e.g. outside some shop you'll be visiting regularly anyway), revisit when you've picked up new ones. The only reason to actually bring Myron along is to hear other characters pick on him, and see his level up comments.

  <ul>
  <li>Main skill: Science.
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Energy Weapons.
  </li><li>Animations: Throw, knife, pistol.
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level: 70, 77, 92, 107, 122.
  </li><li>AP progression by level: 7, 7, 7, 7, 8.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: You can let him use the Needler Pistol until you run out of ammo for it. Get him a Plasma Pistol or if possible a Pulse Pistol. Expect him to miss a lot. If you can be bothered to chase after the Alien Blaster, you should do so.</li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Give Myron a Scorpion Tail and he'll make some Antidote. Give him a Broc Flower, a Xander Root and an Empty Hypodermic and he'll make a Stimpak. If you have IN 8 and Science 76% and ask him to make Stimpaks, you can enable the option to make Super Stimpaks; for this he needs a Fruit, a Nuka-Cola and a Stimpak. In practice the number of Stimpaks you can make will be limited by the number of Empty Hypodermics in the game, since you can get unlimited roots and flowers. Theoretically you could make any number of Super Stimpaks, though, since the ingredients for those replenish in shops, random encounters and working Nuka-Cola machines.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Whenever you try to ditch Myron, you can get him to promise to show you the location of a Mordino stash in Golgotha (which appears on your world map if it wasn't there before) in exchange for not doing so. He doesn't actually actively show you to it, but the stash exists; see the Golgotha section for the details. Once you dig it up, he'll promise to carry more stuff instead (apparently this was supposed to raise his Carry Weight by 10, but it doesn't work).</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You can't use Jet on him, but if you put it in his inventory, he'll use it on himself in combat. Hmm...</blockquote>

  <b>Brain Bot:</b> A.k.a. Skynet, which refers to the best incarnation of this NPC and the only one that can earn levels. This robot is found in the Sierra Army Depot and must be assembled before it can get on the road. Whether it's useful or not depends on which brain you put into the bot: the cybernetic or human brain will produce a sniperbot, while any lesser brain produces a stupid donkeybot. Since it's possible you won't be able to get Skynet until late in the game, you might already have Gauss Rifles on Vic and Cassidy, and if so you won't need another sniper. It's always painfully slow. You can use Repair to heal the Brain Bot for a few points (three times a day), but not use tools.

  <ul>
  <li>Skill: Unarmed (2 worst brains), Small Guns (2 best brains).
  </li><li>Other notable skills: Unarmed (best brain, high levels).
  </li><li>Animations: SMG, rifle.
  </li><li>AC/DT/DR: 20/8/40 (1), 20/5/40 (2-6, 3 worst brains).
  </li><li>Hit Point progression by level (best brain only): 115, 143, 155, 179, 197, 210
  </li><li>AP progression by level (best brain only): 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.
  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression (2 best brains only): .223 Pistol, Pancor Jackhammer or HK P90c then Gauss Rifle, or H&amp;K G11E if you want it spraying expensive ammo. It can eventually use a Power Fist to some effect, though not as well as guns.
  </li></ul>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The Brain Bot is the only NPC that can't be healed using First Aid, Doctor or chems. However, Skynet can repair itself to full HP using its internal repair systems if you tell it to. What if they shoot up its internal repair systems? Well, that's what backup internal repair systems are for.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  To begin with, the Brain Bot has no protection against EMP damage. Levelling up once is enough for Skynet to gain full protection.</blockquote>

  <b>Robodog:</b> A.k.a. Cyberdog. Found in New California Republic. Don't pick him up. Although Robodog is primarily organic and can be healed using First Aid and Doctor, you can also use a Tool or a Super Tool Kit on him about once per hour, which will heal 10-40 HP if you pass a Repair check. You will also be able to heal him more efficiently if you have good Speech - don't ask. Robodog is another of those "same HP for two levels" critters.

  <ul>
  <li>Skill: Unarmed (of course - he doesn't have arms. Ha ha ha! Sorry).
  </li><li>AC/DT/DR: 10/4/30.

  </li><li>Suggested weapon progression: None.
  </li></ul>

  <b>Goris:</b> Found in Vault 13. If he's with you at the time of the Vault 13 massacre, he'll leave to return there. Once you go there you can pick him up again. But would you want to? He can't use armour, and the animation where he removes and wears his robe is annoying as hell.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  There's a bug where, if you try to pick Goris up after the Vault 13 massacre, he'll join you but every time immediately leaves your party again (because a variable is never reset). This happens if he's in Vault 13 and you didn't already go through the "pack is in trouble" thing (which would be true if you never had him in your party before). To counteract the bug just save and load the game, or leave Vault 13 so that you are outside the vault door, then return and recruit Goris.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  When Goris leaves your party, either because of his pack being in trouble or because he doesn't like you, he actually tags along invisibly, waiting for you to pass by Vault 13 so he can reappear in his usual position. In this state he does not count towards the party member limit; however, as discovered by Sy he <i>will</i> continue to gain levels as if he were in your party.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Starseeker adds in defence of Goris: "I actually consider Goris to be a better character than most because of his high percentage of critical hits. He can usually take out a floater in one or two turns for me, and he carries more stuff." In my own experience, however, Goris doesn't compare to Sulik and Cassidy equipped with Mega Power Fists and Power Armor even at his highest level, and his relative lack of combat options tends to leave him extremely vulnerable. Also, unless you take a shortcut to pick Goris up early, you'll have to wander the wastes a lot to get him to that level.</blockquote>

  <b>K-9:</b> Found in Navarro. Another useless robodog (albeit the best dog NPC, for what it's worth). Actually the game calls it "Cybernetic Dog". K-9 counts as an organic creature for healing purposes but has only 50% resistance to EMP damage (something to think about if you ever send your henchdogs into close combat with robots while you supportively lob Pulse Grenades from behind).

  <ul>

  <b>Dogmeat:</b> Found in the Cafe of Broken Dreams special encounter. Pick him up if it's early in the game, or for the nostalgia value, or to attack him and kill Mel.

  <ul>
  <li>Skill: Unarmed.

If you kill Dogmeat in a single round Mel won't appear. Additionally, when Dogmeat isn't in your party, he's considered by the game to be on the NCR team. This means if you attack him in NCR, the cops will shoot you!</blockquote>

  <b>Pariah dog:</b> Found in a special encounter and described in that section. Someone somewhere obviously likes the idea of dog NPCs. This one will join over the party limit and follow you indefinitely, but you can't give it instructions, tell it to stay or anything.

  You can also gain some more or less temporary allies who will follow and fight alongside you but who do not function as true party members (not counting those who'll only join you for a single battle):<br><br>

  <b>Smoke:</b> Nagor's dog in Arroyo.<br><br>

  <b>Yellow dog:</b> The dog in Klamath.<br><br>

  <b>Smiley:</b> The trapper stuck in the Toxic Caves.<br><br>

  <a name="car"></a><h3>Car</h3>

  <blockquote>"I told 'em. 'We need traffic signs', I said. But did they listen? Noooo... let's not listen to ol' Lumpy!"<br>
  --Lumpy</blockquote>

  Here I'll gather some details and information on the car, which is a major convenience factor in the game and a very nifty feature. It will let you zoom between locations and makes it a lot easier to avoid random encounters when you get them. How you get it is detailed in the Den and Gecko sections. If your IN is below 4 you have to chew Mentats at least once to enable the dialogue choices that will earn you the car. You can always kill Skeeter for the car part, but Smitty is another matter (and raising Repair to 110% that early in the game to fix the car yourself is a bit unrealistic).<br><br>

  The car runs on energy supplied by Small Energy Cells or Micro Fusion Cells. You'll see how much "gas" there is left in the car when you look at it, measured in a percentage. One full pack (40) of Small Energy Cell will refuel the car by 20 percentage units. One full pack of Micro Fusion Cell (50) will refuel the car by 50 percentage units. (You will see different numbers elsewhere, but these are correct.) Use your chosen fuel on the middle or forward section of the car to refuel it.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  What fuel you should use depends mostly on what weapons you're using. If you're into ranged combat, using SEC to refuel the car is most often the sensible choice, since several good weapons like the Pulse and Plasma Rifles use MFC. On the other hand, SEC is used by Power Fists, the Pulse Pistol and the Alien Blaster. I always end up with more than enough of both. In terms of bartering the two fuel types are exactly on a par.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Using SEC or MFC on a party member will refuel the car. Interesting, eh? It even works if the car is not on the same map! This is probably because the car is technically an NPC.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Refuelling the car can be tricky because of a bug. If, after you choose the backpack icon and select the SEC or MFC to use on the car, your mouse pointer happens to be over a critter or an object, your character might try to interact with that critter or object instead. If this happens, scroll the screen a little in whichever direction and try again. (This bug is not actually car-specific.) Also if you stand next to the trunk when refuelling, this may cause you to access the trunk instead.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The Pathfinder perk will reduce your fuel consumption by the same proportion that it diminishes travel time, i.e. 20% (see Character Design for a note on Pathfinder). It would still be a stupid way to spend a perk.</blockquote>

  If you run out of fuel, the car will appear as a green circle on the world map marked "Car Outta Fuel". You can go there at any time to refuel and be off again. If you happen to be within a town circle at the moment this happens, the car will be on the town map instead.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The moment when you run out of fuel is critical, because a car bug may strike and teleport the car circle across the map or make it vanish altogether. It should be a rare event in a normal game, but if you spend several years cruising the wasteland you might see it happen. To avoid this you may want to refuel regularly, and save, of course.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  It can reportedly also happen that the car circle ends up within a town circle, and you won't be able to get to the car because you'll end up entering the town instead (where the car won't be). In this case the car is irretrievably lost and you should revert to a saved game immediately. Note that as long as some small part of the car circle is outside the town map square, you should be able to get to the car as long as you click outside of that square.</blockquote>

  There are four different upgrades available in the game for the car, one of them only after you complete the game. One is available in the Den (regulator), one in NCR (blower) and two in the same place in New Reno (engine/trunk and grav-plates); see these areas for details.<br><br>

  The car's trunk is invaluable to store items you pick up, excess ammo and weaponry (also if you're the kind of player who wants to keep used quest items at hand just in case... but keep in mind the "too many items" bug!). Early in the game it can seem limitless, but you'll find out it's not. The trunk's capacity for holding things (250 to begin with, 275 after the upgrade) is based on item size, a factor which is not displayed in the game but is 7-15 for armour, 1-6 for weapons and 0-1 for most other items and drugs (a Rope and a Lighter are both size 1). Some weightless items like Jet have size 1, so you may want to keep these in your inventory. Another important fact is that ammo (including rockets and fuel tanks) does not take up space in the trunk, so you should happily store any ammo you're not using for the moment in the trunk. 9mm ball and BB's are exceptions, but you never find too much of those. Thrown weapons like grenades are not ammo and do take up trunk space.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Since later in the game you should always have more spare weaponry than the shopkeepers can trade you cash or ammo for, there's virtually never any need to trade away ammo. Even if you don't really plan to use a Rocket Launcher at all, there's no reason to sell rockets you've found before you've sold everything else you're not going to keep, such as, I don't know, excess Combat Shotguns. So generally you should constantly be trading bulky weapons for all sorts of ammo you think might become even remotely useful.</blockquote>

  Before the patch, the car was one of the most bugged features in the game. It can still happen after the patch that the car simply disappears (but remember there's a couple of places where your car may move but not be lost, see Raiders and New Reno). Some have said that if this happens you can usually find the car somewhere it shouldn't be (Broken Hills, New Reno, NCR, or wherever), but if you have the option you should reload or revert to an earlier save, since you won't necessarily see the car again at all.</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"Ooooh! Butunz!"<br>
  --The Chosen One</blockquote>

  Playing a game with Intelligence lower than 4 will be quite different, so I'm giving it a section of its own. The basic difference is of course that most people won't talk to you, or they won't give you quests, plus there's the fact that you almost never get to use a computer. You'll notice straight away in Arroyo and Klamath that you can't do as many things or gain as many bonuses, and as a result your character will level up much more slowly as you progress through areas. You'll miss out on many juicy enhancements to your character like the free Unarmed training in SF, the combat implants, training in Arroyo and Klamath, and so on. In this way the stupid game is not very balanced: a difference of a single char point to IN and suddenly half of the game is taken from you. But I suppose it would have been difficult to implement in any other way, and we should be glad it's there at all.<br><br>

  If you're going to play a stupid game you should keep your IN at 3 - you're getting few skill points as it is! Using the Skilled trait may seem like a good remedy, but I say it's not worth it. The fact that you get fewer skill points is balanced by the fact that you don't have to invest in Speech, and also of course there aren't many skills you really <i>need</i>. To begin with you should choose one combat skill and stick to that for a while at least, Small Guns being the obvious choice since it will carry you through the entire game, more or less. Devote early skill points to Lockpick for looting and Doctor for convenience, put later points into Big Guns for a secondary weapon skill, and study all those books you find.<br><br>

  You can usually do the stuff or parts of stuff that doesn't require dialogue, e.g. you can fix Bess' leg in Modoc but not sell her to Grisham, and you can help Charlie in Vault City with RadAway. You get xp for finding the Raiders even though you never got that quest, and you get xp for clearing the Redding mine even though you didn't buy the deed. Sometimes you can "simulate" quests if you know what's needed to trigger certain reactions, e.g. you can kill the Dragon or Lo Pan with Super Stimpaks and then collect a reward from the other.<br><br>

  Since you level up so slowly, most big battles will be much too difficult for you when you first come across them. For instance, you won't be able to free Vic without killing Metzger's band of slavers, and you couldn't possibly do that at level 3 without playing dirty. Likewise you'll most likely have to circumvent the raiders and the wanamingos for some time. I was able to take out Darion's gang at level 9 by using Plasma Grenades and saving and loading a lot during combat, but only returned for the raiders and wanamingos after I got a Gauss Rifle in San Francisco.<br><br>

  Area progression will work roughly like this: first you go to Klamath where you can get the location of the Den from Torr. In the Den you can get the location of Vault City from Vic - only you'd have to kill Metzger first! Since you probably can't, let's just head east in a random fashion. Eventually, after stumbling across Modoc, you come to Vault City purely by chance. You don't get Gecko on your map, but the central computer in the vault will give you the four other towns and Vault 15 (which can also be found from NCR). Vault 13 can be found in Vault 15, or by following the deathclaws. Next you'll have to find the Military Base on your own, and use the Survey Map there to find San Francisco. Matthew will put Navarro on your map and that's it.<br><br>

  In a strictly stupid game you normally wouldn't get the car. This sucks, so what can we do about it? First, go to Gecko and kill Skeeter for the car part (you won't have to fight the other ghouls). Steal Lynette's Mentats while passing through Vault City. Return to the Den with $2750 (you should have just enough) and the two car parts, eat the Mentats, talk to Smitty and install the parts. You'll now be able to drive around like in a normal game, at least if you're able to find or trade for enough fuel (I had no problem with that). Note that you need Mentats again to get the upgrades in NCR and New Reno, but you can manage without them.<br><br>

  NPC management could be difficult. You can get a few of them (Sulik, Vic, Goris, K-9, Dogmeat, and you can of course use Mentats to recruit others), but you won't really be able to talk to any of them except Goris and Dogmeat. This means, for instance, that you can't get them to put away their weapons as you enter NCR, and you can't drop them off anywhere. Anyway, since CH is largely wasted on a stupid character as far as dialogue in concerned, maybe you won't be able to have many followers to begin with. It's up to you if you want to go solo or if you need the edge in combat.<br><br>

  As you reach the last few areas on the mainland, prepare for your game to get a little backward. In a normal game I tend to avoid stupid shortcut techniques and instead take on each challenge in the "proper" order armed with whatever NPCs and equipment I have at the time. In a stupid game this may not be feasible, which leads to some weird choices. For instance, should you invest in perks and weaponry so you could take on the mutants at the Military Base and get the Power Armor? Or should you amass weapons and cash so you could buy the Power Armor in SF instead? But if you're going to do that, why not simply drive to Navarro, waltz in and pick up the Advanced Power Armor for free? In short, the temptation to resort to stupid shortcut techniques will increase as the linearity of the game breaks down. I would recommend that you resist for as long as you are able.<br><br>

  For quests and stuff there are always Mentats, which I suppose you could theoretically keep in unlimited or at least generous supply. However, this would seem to defeat the point of playing a stupid game to begin with. Therefore Mentats should only be used when there is something you feel you absolutely need to do like getting the car, getting a certain area like the Sierra Army Depot on your map, or when you need to meet the requirements of a favourite perk like Bonus Rate of Fire.<br><br>

  There are a few ways of increasing your IN permanently during the game: the Gain Intelligence perk, the Yellow Memory Module, and the Hubologist alignment in San Francisco. Naturally you should stay away from these or your stupid game won't be stupid any more, assuming you start out at IN 3. The Smooth Talker perk requires IN 4 to get, but once you have it it'll make you talk unstupidly if it raises your IN above 3 for dialogue purposes.<br><br>

  Here's a brief summary of what can be done at the various locations:<br><br>

  <b>Arroyo:</b> You can kill the plants for Hakunin and let him mix Healing Powder for you.<br><br>

  <b>Klamath:</b> You can kill the rat king and protect the brahmin. You can get Sulik.<br><br>

  <b>Toxic Caves:</b> You need Mentats to put it on on your world map, but you can rescue Smiley once you do and get the Gecko Skinning perk.<br><br>

  <b>The Den:</b> You can lay Anna to rest if you kill Joey for the locket. You can find Vic, but you need to kill the slavers to get him in your party (and Vault City on your map) and you may find it difficult to do that early on. You can become a Slaver. You can collect Rebecca's reward for killing Metzger.<br><br>

  <b>Modoc/Ghost Farm:</b> You can do the first two Slag quests, guard Grisham's brahmin and clean out Farrel's garden.<br><br>

  <b>Vault City:</b> You can get the autodoc perk. You can give the doll to Curtis. You can visit the vault and get the travel log.<br><br>

  <b>Gecko:</b> You can't do anything.<br><br>

  <b>Raiders:</b> As normal.<br><br>

  <b>Broken Hills:</b> You can arm-wrestle Francis, take the scorpion tests, relocate the plant and recover Typhon's treasure.<br><br>

  <b>Redding:</b> You can't do anything.<br><br>

  <b>New Reno:</b> You can recover the car in a violent manner and go with the Wright children to watch the desert transaction. Male characters can box. You can become a Porn Star and paralyze Jimmy.<br><br>

  <b>Golgotha/Stables/Sierra Army Depot:</b> You can't get these on your world map without Mentats. Nothing exciting going on except for calling Marjorie Reed "Delenn".<br><br>

  <b>NCR:</b> You can get the zeta scan, kill Jack for Mira, guard Westin's brahmin and do Duppo's brahmin drive. You can also take the Vault 15 job.<br><br>

  <b>Vault 15:</b> You can do everything except expose the spy.<br><br>

  <b>Vault 13:</b> You can do everything, even get Goris.<br><br>

  <b>Military Base:</b> As normal.<br><br>

  <b>San Francisco:</b> You can get the vertibird plans for the Brotherhood and get the stat improvements afterwards, get the zeta scan, kill Ken Lee for the Hubologists and rescue Suze.<br><br>

  <b>Navarro:</b> Pretty much as normal, oddly enough. You can get K-9.<br><br>

  <b>Enclave:</b> You'll have to destroy the reactor using explosives and fight Horrigan on your own, otherwise nothing special.<br><br>

  <b>Special encounters:</b> You cannot talk to Arthur, otherwise nothing special. You can get Dogmeat.<br><br><hr>

  <a name="combat"></a><h3>Combat</h3>

  <blockquote>"Look, causing that much destruction wasn't easy!"<br>
  --The Chosen One</blockquote>

  This is not supposed to be a be-all and end-all guide to <i>Fallout</i> tactics, just a collection of hints and comments that fit under a common heading.

  <h4>General</h4>

  You can alter combat difficulty for a single battle if you're having problems. Of course, most often you also have the option to leave and return with bigger guns and more friends.<br><br>

  When scouting an area before a fight you can use the A key to enter combat mode and see if there are any critters hidden behind walls or scenery. If you want to examine an obscured critter with the Awareness perk, turn on the "combat looks" option.<br><br>

  Every time you access your inventory during a fight to gobble Stimpaks, use as many as you think you're going to need, and also reload any readied ranged weapons by dragging ammo onto your active item slot. You can use Stimpaks or other chems on your party members or yourself from inventory using the backpack icon for a cost of 2 AP each time (so keeping such items in an active item slot is pointless). This is good to remember not least when you desperately need healing but don't have quite enough AP to view inventory.<br><br>

  Psycho is probably the best chem for combat since it actually protects you from damage while also possibly giving you an extra AP or two. I tend never to use any drugs myself, but if you think it'll make a difference, why not. Buffout's marginal, raising stats just isn't that good (and boosting EN doesn't even raise your Hit Points). Jet is mostly annoying because of the addiction rate and low duration, so I wouldn't bother with it.<br><br>

  Reload your weapon after every fight so you have a fresh clip at the start of the next. (This may seem obvious, but is easy to forget.)<br><br>

  The smaller your chance of hitting someone, the greater the chance of a critical failure. This applies no matter the reason your chance to hit is low (bad light, long range, aimed shot, obstructing targets etc.). So don't even try using a ranged weapon if your chance to hit is below 15%. Guns can get destroyed, and energy weapons, Flamers, Rocket Launchers and grenades can even explode in your face.<br><br>

  Sometimes a fleeing enemy may run off the edge of the map, or onto an exit grid. If this happens it might be possible to lure it back after combat. Move away a bit and see if the critter walks back onto the screen on its own. If it doesn't, try walking towards the spot it disappeared, since it may come running towards you when combat starts even if it was running away the moment before. Your NPCs can shoot critters that are offscreen, but then you obviously won't be able to loot their corpses.<br><br>

  About the only time in the game when poison becomes a problem is when you're surrounded by a bunch of floaters and/or centaurs. They'll give you a lot of poison counters even if they never penetrate your armour, and once your Poison Level reaches 100, any excess points are converted to damage at an exchange rate of two to one. In this way those floaters can hurt you quite a lot without ever scratching your skin, which is a little, well, odd, but that's how it works. Wanamingo-like aliens and centaurs in random encounters can radiate you in a similar fashion.<br><br>

  When using burst weapons, each bullet is treated individually when it comes to penetration, damage etc., so it's possible to fire full auto and not do very much damage against an armoured opponent. (Try the 10mm SMG on the aliens in Redding and you'll see what I mean.) This also makes the perk Bonus Ranged Damage more useful, but Living Anatomy does <i>not</i> add damage to each bullet.<br><br>

  An important note on ammo: due to poor item design, AP (armour piercing) ammo does not really do what you'd expect it to, namely pierce armour. This is because a) the modification to Damage Resistance does not nearly compensate for the much lower base damage, and b) it does not modify Damage Threshold at all. Hence in virtually any situation you're better off using JHP ammo for greater damage. Might as well make it a rule of thumb to sell off all kinds of AP ammo if you have the other type available (HN AP Needler Cartridges and AP Rockets being exceptions). Or just store it forever in the trunk.<br><br>

  Basic rule: when comparing two guns, look at the ammo modifiers, especially the damage multiplier, and not just the weapon damage - check out the table in Items. Also consider rate of fire if applicable, and range if you're the sniping kind.<br><br>

  Ammo weight is based upon how many rounds make up one ammo "item". For instance, 1-24 10mm JHP bullets will weigh 1 pound, 25-48 will weigh 2 pounds, and so on. Any amount of ammo in a weapon always counts as one item; it is for this reason the total weight carried may go up as you reload a weapon. Always unload guns that you pick up as loot, since you're usually keeping the ammo and selling the gun anyway.<br><br>

  If it's not completely obvious, you can unload weapons in shops and trade for the ammo.<br><br>

  Before getting into a fight with initially non-hostile people, you can of course use Steal to relieve them of any chems, Stimpaks, extra ammo or even guns. Personally I don't use Steal overmuch so I wouldn't bother with this either.<br><br>

  If you knock someone unconscious, they won't necessarily be hostile when they wake up (depends on their script). You can use this to knock someone down and take their equipment if you hadn't planned to kill them. Also people won't always be hostile if you run to an exit grid and then come back. In many townships, however, just attacking someone turns everyone permanently hostile.<br><br>

  Your chance to hit increases by 40% against an opponent that's lying down. You'll probably want to take the opportunity to make a called attack or two.<br><br>

  MÃªlÃ©e attacks give a +5% bonus to your Critical Chance.

  <h4>Tactics and party management</h4>

  As was explained in the Toxic Caves section, holding the A key as the game is loading a new area will let you get a jump on opponents. You can also open a door to a room with monsters and hit A (or click your active weapon slot) while the door opens, thus getting the first shot.<br><br>

  Take advantage of AI "features". For instance, critters will always react upon seeing you, not your party members (simply because they're scripted that way), and will try to attack you first. Normally they won't attack your NPCs unless they receive significantly more damage from them than from you. If you move out of the way of enemies with ranged weapons they will come running to catch up with you, giving your party members free shots at them. Sometimes critters ignore your NPCs completely, and you can then run back and forth while your comrades fire at the luckless monsters.<br><br>

  In a difficult battle against many enemies, make sure your party stays together. If you kill all foes in one room, for instance, an NPC on the "on your own" setting will happily charge into the next by themselves even if that means exposure to massive fire. To prevent this you should put them on "stay close to me" or "stay where you are", so that you can pick off the opposition as they come to you and not the other way around. Bottlenecks are key tactical features on any map.<br><br>

  In preparation for some battles you can separate the enemy forces into smaller groups by locking doors; the fight against Metzger in the Den is a good example, and you can do this when taking on the Mordino family as well. It could make a battle a whole lot easier, but on the other hand it's also kind of silly, like stealing weapons before a fight.<br><br>

  Duck behind walls a lot if you can, using spare Action Points. Enemies who start running will often spend all their AP for that round moving if they can, only attacking when they're right next to you even if they have ranged weapons. You can take advantage of this to snipe your opponents and leading them on for as long as possible. Using a single AP you may be able to force the opposition to waste an entire turn.<br><br>

  If you practice aimed shots you can take advantage of an AI oddity. Many critters will turn and run if you cripple their legs (which aren't too difficult to hit), despite the fact that running is probably the one thing they've suddenly become much worse at. This effectively renders them completely harmless. For robots the tender spot is the sensors. People with rifles or big guns should be shot in the arm.<br><br>

  Your NPCs will never switch targets during a round. If you try to finish off weak opponents you reduce the risk of your NPCs "wasting" a shot.<br><br>

  Be careful about giving burst weapons to certain trigger-happy party members (Sulik and Marcus). While NPCs will try to avoid burst-firing you, they'll sometimes do it to other party members, and they'll also do it more often if you have full HP and good armour (i.e. they think you can take it). A good way to counter this is to equip them with single shot weapons (Sniper Rifle, .233 Pistol, Gauss Rifle, Turbo Plasma Rifle). This way they also won't waste ammo by burst-firing a target across the whole screen.<br><br>

  You may want to avoid putting certain mÃªlÃ©e weapons on your NPCs altogether (e.g. spears or sledgehammers on Sulik, knives on Vic), because sometimes when they don't have enough AP for a ranged attack they'll equip the mÃªlÃ©e weapon and not switch back on their own, which is a) bad, and b) damn annoying. On the other hand, you might want a Super Sledge on Sulik in case he runs out of ammo for his favourite SMG. Or just make sure he doesn't. Note: you can sometimes use combat settings to prevent this, e.g. you can put Vic on ranged only, but not Sulik.<br><br>

  Take your own and everyone else's favourite mode of combat into account when designing tactics for your team. If you and Goris are going to charge into close combat, it's not a very good thing to have Marcus standing behind you with a Bozar or Rocket Launcher. Single shot weapons will work fine, though, i.e. Turbo Plasma Rifle on Marcus, Gauss Rifles or Sniper Rifles for you, Vic and Cassidy.<br><br>

  Always take out enemies armed with Rocket Launchers or Grenades first, especially if you're in a tight formation with party members. This goes for super mutants as well as rocket-packing robots. May depend on your armour, though; with Advanced Power Armor on you might be more concerned with the potential critical hits of Gauss Rifles and Laser Rifles.<br><br>

  If you're playing HtH, you're probably going to end up chasing a lot of runners. One way of catching up is to end combat if possible and then sneak up on them. Another is to let your NPCs do the chasing since critters will only run from you and not them; but this doesn't work if your NPCs are on the "stay close to me" setting. Yet another way is to bring a gun for this purpose.<br><br>

  It seems to me that NPCs equipped with HtH weapons tend to "sleep" more, i.e. stand idle even if there's an enemy right in front of them, and use Stimpaks less, even if they're mortally wounded. To some extent (but not all) this may be caused by a combination of combat settings. You'll have to decide if you want to give them more freedom to move around and pick their targets, or if you want to keep them close. It also seems that one or more NPCs armed with ranged weapons can help them "wake up"; for instance, when I faced Horrigan with Sulik, Cassidy and Goris armed with mÃªlÃ©e weapons none of them would lift a finger to help unless I got Horrigan to shoot them by accident. However, when I switched Cassidy to a gun he would fire on Horrigan, and after a couple of turns of this Goris and Sulik joined in as well.

  <h4>Suggested weapon progressions</h4>

  There are lots of weapons in <i>Fallout 2</i>, many of which you'll probably never use. Whoever stormed their enemies wielding a Club or a Sawed-Off Shotgun? Yet there are still enough choices that the optimal weapon progression can't be summarized in two paragraphs like in the <i>Fallout</i> guide. A few things might be noted in advance. One is that I'm assuming you play the areas in the "proper" order. Not every weapon deserves a mention; some weapons I'll just skip because they suck (Rocks), others because they appear when you already have better alternatives ("Little Jesus").<br><br>

  The beginning is pretty uncomplicated. You start out with a Spear, which can shortly be upgraded to a Sharpened Spear. Unless you tagged Melee Weapons your Unarmed skill will be slightly higher, which will give you increased speed and chance to hit at the cost of some damage while battling ants and geckos.<br><br>

  Decent early Melee Weapons include the Sharpened Spear which has good damage and a 2-hex range, and the Combat Knife (buy or find in Klamath) which has a lower AP cost. Weapon progression for HtH characters is slower and jerkier than for ranged weapons, so you'll probably have to make do with these for quite a while. You may be able to get hold of a Cattle Prod relatively early, but you'll be hard pressed to find enough ammo.<br><br>

  One way of getting a good weapon quickly (that has a low AP cost and doesn't require ammo) is to go to New Reno and finish Mrs Wright's quest for the Louisville Slugger. The Wakizashi Blade found in the vicinity is also a step up from the Combat Knife, and though it doesn't compare to the Slugger it's an option if you want a cool weapon early on but feel strongly about stupid shortcut techniques.<br><br>

  If you arrive in NCR before taking on the New Reno quests, you can get yourself a Ripper. Not worth it if you have or are soon getting the Slugger, though, or if you've upgraded that old Cattle Prod (which is still slightly inferior to the Louisville Slugger, may depend on your AP). The Super Sledge, available in SF or from Eldridge once you become a Made Man, is of course the end of the Melee Weapons progression, but by that time you may find yourself tempted to switch to Unarmed anyway. I'd recommend that you wait until you get the training in San Francisco before building Unarmed, but once done it will probably make your game a little smoother since the Mega Power Fist doesn't have the knockback effect.<br><br>

  For Unarmed weapons, you can steal Spiked Knuckles from the Duntons in Klamath, then nothing, then nothing, then once you get to Broken Hills or NCR you can get the upgradable Power Fist. Hopefully you can also trade for all the Small Energy Cell you need in NCR by then. The Mega Power Fist represents the end of this progression and requires only a quick trip to New Reno (though a stupid character would have to buy it in SF). By this time you also have a few fancy special kicks and punches, but if you look at their AP cost they're just not that attractive compared to the Power Fist.<br><br>

  Now for guns. Guns are more fun. Really! It starts out with the Pipe Rifle (if only because you get it for free in Klamath), which is good for rat hunting in Trapper Town but not much more. Since you have to reload it for each shot its AP cost is basically equivalent to 7, which is not so good. Still, it's your first firearm. The 10mm Pistol which can be bought or found in Klamath is quite wonderful in comparison.<br><br>

  Once you get to the Den there are a few more alternatives, notably the Hunting Rifle, the 10mm SMG (buy from Tubby, or wait until you can get it for free in VC) and the .44 Magnum Revolver (buy from Flick, or from Harry in VC). The latter is a personal favourite of mine in the early mid-game: the AP cost and damage make it superior to all other handguns except the .223 Pistol, and it has a lovely "blam" firing sound. That it can be upgraded (which increases its range as well) is just icing on the cake. With the Sniper perk and a Luck of 9-10, the .44 Magnum becomes a lethal weapon against any foe (but then again, so does everything else). Of the two types of .44 ammo, FMJ is marginally better unless you count on getting lots of no-armour criticals, in which case the JHP delivers more raw damage.<br><br>

  The 10mm SMG, on the other hand, is your first burst-fire weapon, but you may not have too much ammo for it before you kill Metzger's bunch in the Den. Well, not much to fight until after Gecko, anyway. Advanced shotguns or other burst-fire weapons are probably the way to go after that. The first one available is the Combat Shotgun in Vault City. You'll probably only use the H&amp;K CAWS if you find it in a random encounter; it fires more bullets in each burst, but you have to reload it after two bursts. The Pancor Jackhammer from NCR is the best shotgun in the game, but has a few SMG rivals to contend with in the late mid-game.<br><br>

  The "Grease Gun" which can be bought in New Reno is superior to other early burst weapons (such as the largely uninteresting FN FAL) by virtue of its AP cost, but cannot measure up to later SMGs since it fires nondescript .45 Caliber. The H&amp;K G11 from Redding is a favourite of mine. You don't have much ammo for it to begin with, but it's got a large magazine and fires reasonably small bursts. If you stop by NCR every now and then, it's not impossible to use the H&amp;K G11 as your main weapon throughout the mid-game. If you take your time you may run into Snake Morton and get his H&amp;K G11E. The HK P90c is comparable in power, costs 1 AP less to fire but doesn't penetrate armour as well, uses common 10mm ammo and becomes available in NCR.<br><br>

  I mentioned the Hunting Rifle earlier; it could be said to kick off the sniping weapon progression in the Den. You can have it upgraded cheaply in Gecko or NCR, or even get a Scoped Hunting Rifle for free in Broken Hills. The Sniper Rifle is next after that (SAD, Vault 15), having a greater range and doing more damage than the Scoped Hunting Rifle, but it has a smaller magazine and costs 1 AP more to fire. Your call.<br><br>

  I should probably mention the .223 Pistol again, if only because it's cool (good damage, but falls a little short of being a true sniping weapon). The Needler Pistol is comparable in range and power if you use the good ammo, which is pretty scarce however. One more freaky alternative is the Red Ryder LE BB Gun (usually found in the SAD, can also be bought in NCR), which has a good AP cost, needs hardly ever be reloaded and can be quite dangerous if you have the Sniper perk, but has rather a short range for a rifle.<br><br>

  Gauss weapons represent the merging of the burst and sniping paths for Small Guns. Both of them have a very long range and good armour penetration. The Gauss Rifle offers a lot of damage even without the most cruel perks in place, while the Gauss Pistol can be fired for 2 AP with Fast Shot and Bonus Rate of Fire; with the Sniper perk and 10-12 AP this means you can often knock down several tough opponents each turn. This is why you don't really need any other combat skill than Small Guns.<br><br>

  You won't find many big guns early on. You can find M60s in random encounters near Redding, get the Bozar from the Toxic Caves, or buy the Avenger Minigun in NCR. Against unarmoured or lightly armoured targets it doesn't really matter much which one of these you use, if you get to apply it up close anyway. Once you face people in power armour or tough deathclaws you'll want some stopping power, though; the Bozar and the Vindicator Minigun stand out here. The Vindicator Minigun is arguably the most devastating weapon all round, but has the downside of guzzling 4.7mm Caseless ammo which is not nearly as common as 5mm JHP for the Avenger Minigun or .223 FMJ for the Bozar. This means you probably can't use it as your main weapon for any extended period of time. Against a well-armoured opponent the Avenger Minigun won't cut it because of the ammo modifiers, so you might as well go with the Bozar from the start if you like big guns.<br><br>

  Early Energy Weapons aren't all that good: the Plasma Pistol (Toxic Caves, SAD), for instance, is clearly inferior to the .223 Pistol, and you simply don't want to go around dispensing laser damage. The Plasma Rifle (also SAD) is OK, though, and its upgraded version with improved range and damage is quite nifty. You need ST 6 to handle it, however.<br><br>

  The pulse weapons normally become available after you've been to Navarro. Of these the Pulse Rifle is perhaps the most efficient, being light, having a decent range, and doing serious damage to everything except floaters. If you have Fast Shot, Bonus Rate of Fire and Sniper you can take out most enemies. While the Pulse Pistol is by no means bad, it falls short of the Gauss Pistol because of its small magazine and short range. The Alien Blaster is perhaps something of an extravaganza; it works similarly to the Pulse Pistol only its range is even shorter.<br><br>

  Finally the Throwing weapon progression. Ummm. Well, to begin with you have Spears (Throwing Knives cost 1 less AP to throw, but it's not worth it in terms of damage)... and the odd Molotov Cocktail. A Sharpened Spear is better than a regular Spear, of course, but you'll only have one of those. Later on you can get hold of a few Frag Grenades (kill dogs with them), even later you get Plasma Grenades (kill unarmoured people with them) and Pulse Grenades for those special robot encounters. Once you feel you've got the hang of it and have managed to hoard some grenades, critters will rapidly begin to develop armour and care less and less about the deadly explosives you toss their way. Since none of the Sniper or Slayer perks applies for thrown weapons, you may as well use up your grenades early in the game (you can often hope to hit something at short range and low skill level) and prepare to switch to a decent weapon skill.

  <h4>Random weapons and ammo notes</h4>

  Some people advise against "wasting" ammo on the Pipe Rifle or 10mm Pistol early in the game, shooting rats and geckos and stuff. I disagree completely: Klamath and the Toxic Caves are perhaps the only places where you'll feel that using what limited resources you have makes a whole lot of a difference. After you clean out New Reno, then what will a few hundred rounds of 10mm JHP mean to you? Probably nothing, but if you spend 50 rounds in Klamath blowing away a few pesky rats, it's more than worth it for the satisfaction.<br><br>

  Silly note: in my first game, once I got the Assault Rifle from Vegeir, I kept and used it for a very long time simply because I thought the weapon progression was similar to that in <i>Wasteland</i>, where assault rifles were powerful. It's funny, because I <i>did</i> notice all that time that my NPCs with Combat Shotguns were inflicting much, much more damage than I was. Don't keep this weapon for longer than you have to.<br><br>

  Some weapons have accuracy modifiers that are independent of weapon range and ammo stats. The weapons that give a flat +20% are: 14mm Pistol, 9mm Mauser, Shotgun, Sawed-Off Shotgun, Combat Shotgun, Pancor Jackhammer, PPK12 Gauss Pistol, M72 Gauss Rifle, Alien Blaster and Solar Scorcher. A second category of weapons give a bonus equal to (<nobr>PE-2</nobr>)*8 and these include: Red Ryder LE BB Gun, Hunting Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Assault Rifle, Assault Rifle (Exp. Mag.), Minigun, Rocket Launcher, Laser Rifle, Laser Rifle (Ext. Cap.), Gatling Laser, Plasma Rifle and Turbo Plasma Rifle. Finally, the Scoped Hunting Rifle yields a bonus of (<nobr>PE-2</nobr>)*12 to hit. Note that not many weapons that weren't in <i>Fallout</i> have been given an accuracy bonus, but at least you can't lose one by upgrading something (unless you call trading in your old Minigun for the Avenger variety an upgrade).<br><br>

  The Scoped Hunting Rifle is very inaccurate at a range of 7 hexes or less (which is a little odd, I mean, if they're right in front of you, why not just ignore the scope?), but can be a wonderful implement for picking people off from across the whole screen. The Sniper Rifle, on the other hand, works just fine at short range.<br><br>

  2mm EC ammo for the gauss weapons is often regarded as "rare". I have so far never experienced this and quite happily give Gauss Rifles to both Vic and Cassidy in the late game. Although two shops in VC and NCR are the only ones which provide 2mm EC on a regular basis, the fact that you only use them for single shot attacks makes up for this. I usually end up with thousands of 2mm EC rounds in my trunk just like every other ammo type (before going to the Enclave). If you need more, fight an Enclave patrol (which will also net you extremely valuable weaponry).<br><br>

  If you're adept at both Melee Weapons and a ranged weapon skill, a good late-game combination is to keep the Super Sledge in one item slot and a ranged weapon (like the Gauss Pistol) in the other. This way you can knock them back then fire at them mercilessly.<br><br>

  If you're going to use a Rocket Launcher (or any other Big Gun), it's a good idea to keep a handgun in your other active item slot, like a Gauss Pistol or upgraded .44 Magnum. You'll often find that you can't hit multiple enemies with the Rocket Launcher or a burst weapon, in which case it may be more economical to switch to the handgun and shoot a single target with that instead. Sometimes, too, the only opponents you face may be a pack of howling mantis and deploying a rocket would be your last resort. Lastly, it may well help you get the most out of your Action Points if you switch between a slow and a fast weapon in a round.<br><br>

  Although floaters as noted have a high resistance to electrical damage, they and aliens are rather vulnerable to fire damage. It's pretty unlikely you'd choose to lug a Flamethrower around just for this, though. Small tough deathclaws are most vulnerable to plasma damage, while large ones are sensitive to laser damage for some reason. Frank Horrigan carries armour that's even tougher than Adv. Power Armor MKII, but is vulnerable to electrical damage (so the Pulse Rifle works fine on him). (One might think that Horrigan and Enclave soldiers would be partially vulnerable to EMP damage, but this is not the case.) The vorpal rat and bridgekeeper are resistant to everything.<br><br>

  One drawback with guns that deal electrical damage is that after your enemy dies (neat effect), they'll drop all their equipment in a heap for you to pick up one item at a time instead of using the handy "take all" button. Also this makes it easier for items to become lost behind opaque scenery. Very, very annoying, but if you put the violence level down to normal, your victims will char but not disintegrate.<br><br>

  It seems likely that the M60 and Bozar have had their firing sounds inadvertently exchanged. The M60, which has a "blam" sound in the game, is of course a machine gun, while the Bozar, which has a "rotating barrels" sound like a Gatling, is a kind of sniper rifle according to the description and picture and uses accurate .223 FMJ ammo.<br><br>

  The AC modifier for Rocket AP should probably have belonged to Explosive Rocket instead (to simulate its "splash damage", whereas an AP rocket must hit its target directly to be fully effective). As it is, Rocket AP is strictly superior.<br><br>

  What the FN FAL (Night Sight) does is completely remove darkness modifiers. This only has any significant effect if you're sniping from long range, and it's not worth it anyway - the Hunting Rifle is still vastly superior in darkness because of its ammo and accuracy modifiers.<br><br>

  Some weapons have special "item perks" that presumably improve their performance (the innate accuracy modifiers are of this origin). In some cases the effect is obvious, in others it's more subtle. The Improved Flamer has Flameboy, whatever that means - judging by the item description it's possible the Improved Flamer and the Flamethrower Fuel MKII were meant exclusively for each other, in which case the weapon itself may have no special properties. Sledgehammer, Super Sledge, Louisville Slugger and (Plated) Boxing Gloves (when you're not in the ring) have Knockback. The .44 Magnum (Speed Load) has Fast Reload (gasp). Magneto-Laser Pistol, Ripper, (Mega) Power Fist, .223 Pistol, Claws, Needler Pistol, pulse weapons, Holy Hand Grenade, Wakizashi Blade, "Little Jesus" and End Boss Knife all have Penetrate, which may reduce armour modifiers. The (Super) Cattle Prod and Flare have the Accurate perk which means they grant a +20% to hit bonus. The FN FAL (Night Sight) has, unsurprisingly, the Night Sight perk.<br><br>

  The Sawed-Off Shotgun counts as a one-handed weapon, while the Louisville Slugger, H&amp;K G11 and H&amp;K G11E count as two-handed. This is not obvious from the animations used, so it might be good to know if you're using the One Hander trait.<br><br>

  Here is the deal with Flares: 1) When dropped on the ground in multiples their light effect is cumulative, increasing the radius of the bright spot. 2) When thrown, they are automatically lit if it's dark; this is determined by the map's overall light level. 3) When lit, a Flare burns for two hours and then disappears. 4) Making aimed throws with Flares doesn't increase the AP cost, which is 1. 5) Flares tossed at people in power armour may cause blindness, loss of consciousness, crooked limbs or death pretty much like bullets do, and arguably they are more humiliating. Better Criticals and Living Anatomy are highly recommended. Filip Stefanak argues that this goes a long way towards redeeming the Throwing skill, but at the same time it's a bit cheesy. 6) If a stack of Flares is used on a piece of scenery or on a critter, all of them but one will turn into eternally lit Flares, which can be thrown, reused and sold. This is a bug.<br><br><hr>

  <blockquote>"What do I WANT? I don't really know. Most of the time I ignore my quest and walk into the homes of others, riffling through people's shelves..."<br>
  --The Chosen One</blockquote>

  Locations for common items represent where you're likely to first find them, unless you're using stupid short cut techniques. Non-special random encounters are not considered in this regard, unless the item in question is very rare. If an item appears in more than two or three places in an area I haven't bothered to specify names or locations. Names are given as they appear in the game (e.g. with a missing apostrophe in "Deans Electronics"). These tables are preferably viewed in 800x600 resolution or better.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Shops may not carry certain items right away, e.g. the first time you come to NCR Buster probably won't sell the Avenger Minigun, but after a few days he might. This is simply due to normal random variation of stock and not level dependent. See Klamath for more details on shops and restocking.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  In addition to the items listed here, which can all be found in the game, the items database contains other categories of items such as: <i>Fallout</i> discontinued items or quest items (e.g. the Stealth Boy and Psychic Nullifier), special weaponry only used by critters (e.g. Robo Rocket Launchers and Special Boxing Weapons), unused quest items (a Red Reactor Keycard and a Decomposing Body among others), and programmers having fun (e.g. Trophy of Recognition). They can be viewed if you use an inventory editor, but not all of them have images and few except for the weapons do anything. The list does include a few weapons (Holy Hand Grenade, deathclaw Claws) that can be found without using any kind of utility although they were not really meant to be.</blockquote>

  Damage Threshold/Damage Resistance values are given for normal damage, which is by far the most common damage type for most of the game. Laser damage deviates the most from these values, but isn't used very much. Tesla Armor is special in the way that it offers extra protection against laser and plasma damage... but there's no area where enemies rely exclusively on these damage types, so be prepared to get knocked down with a Wrench or something.</blockquote>

  There are two kinds of damage not shown on the inventory sheet: EMP and electrical. EMP is presumably only used for Pulse Grenades and everyone but robots has a very high resistance level (for the player character that resistance is actually part of the armour definitions, so a "naked" character has no such resistance!). Electrical damage is used for pulse guns, the Alien Blaster, (Super) Cattle Prods and some traps and similar hazards. As a rule of thumb, electrical resistances are the same as plasma.</blockquote>

  AP cost is for the weapon's basic attack. Burst attacks cost 1 AP more for weapons with both single shot and burst capacity. Aimed attacks cost 1 AP more. Sledgehammer and Super Sledge are the only HtH weapons for which thrust and swing attacks don't have the same cost. The difference between swing and thrust attack modes is unclear, but the <i>Fallout</i> manual implies there isn't any (the <i>Fallout 2</i> manual is silent on the matter).</blockquote>

  Gold Nuggets, Uranium Ore and Refined Uranium Ore can all be switched to punch mode, but trying to attack will result in a "Target out of range" message (this is because their range is incorrectly set to zero in the item definitions). Rocks can be used in this way, though. It functions as an Unarmed weapon and adds your Melee Damage to the maximum damage although this doesn't show in the inventory window (the latter goes for Spears etc. as well when not thrown).</blockquote>

  The Pulse Grenade, being the only weapon that inflicts EMP damage, does no damage to non-robot critters, but it can do a lot of damage to <i>you</i> unless you're wearing any kind of armour. I always suspected the Chosen One to be an android. (This is actually because the main character uniquely has the EMP DR as part of the armour item definitions instead of the critter definition.) You can inflict lethal critical hits on living targets with Pulse Grenades, but unless you have the Living Anatomy perk this will cause a bug (see the Toxic Caves section) and will generally be unwanted.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The Solar Scorcher doesn't need ammo to reload, but you can only do so in bright light. This is determined by the map's overall light level, not by the time of day or the light level where you are standing; basically if you can see the spotlight around your character, it's too dark. This means that on some indoor maps like fully lit vaults you can always reload the Scorcher, while on others like the first floor of the Bishop or Mordino casino you never can - unless you have Night Vision, which affects the overall light level directly. The Scorcher deals laser damage, so it's not all that good. I would assume that ammo modifiers all default to zero in this case.</blockquote>

  Effects are permanent unless duration is specified. (Duration given for Healing Powder and Mutated Toe is for the stat penalty only.) The effect of Psycho and Rad-X wears off by one half at a time. You cannot benefit from using more than two doses of a specific chem at the same time, but additional doses can cause addiction. Stats raised by chems will drop below their original values for a period of time after the effect wears off, about as much as the initial bonus. RadAway takes full effect over the course of 4 hours.

  Books raise a skill by a number depending on your current skill level, ranging from 6-7 at low skill levels (20-30%) to 1-2 (70-90%). You get twice that amount if the skill is tagged. This stops at 91% (or 92% if you raise a tagged skill from 90%). Reading a book takes from 1 to 10 hours depending on your Intelligence (i.e. 11-IN).</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Geoffrey Bateman adds on book reading: "You know you can drop your stats in various ways (booze, drugs)? And of course, the skills associated with those stats drop, too. Well, not only will using manuals while your skills are lowered make them more effective, the game also applies the 91% cap to your artifically lowered skill percentage. Then when your stats go back to normal you keep the extra points." In theory you can raise Small Guns, First Aid and Science to 127%, Repair to 118% and Outdoorsman to 115% using this technique, providing that your PE, IN and AG are at 10, your EN is above 3, and all the relevant skills are at 91%. To lose 9 AG, use 2 Buffout, rest 5 hours, use 2 Monument Chunk, then rest 1 hour. To lose 9 IN, use 2 Mentats, rest 24 hours, then use 2 Psycho. To lose 9 PE, drink lots of alcohol. To lose 3 EN, use 2 Buffout, rest 6 hours, use 1 Buffout, then rest 6 hours. "Also, make sure you use all your books from the inventory screen rather than a weapon slot; time won't pass until you close it, so you don't have to worry about your stats coming back before you're done. I also suspect that this would work when using skill points (once you get to the point where it costs more than one to upgrade, obviously)." Yep, it does.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You can play with the difficulty level in a similar manner to get more out of reading books (except Guns and Bullets). Turning the difficulty from easy to normal lowers all non-combat skills by 20%; changing it from normal to hard lowers them by another 10%. You can then read books to get the skills back to 91%, and finally turn difficulty back to normal. Note that if you want to combine this with the drug technique descibed above, you'll have to do them at the same time to maximize your gain.</blockquote>

  You can use alcoholic drinks on people in case you don't want them to shoot straight once you attack them, or if you want to lower their PE before a Sneak or Steal attempt. I haven't noticed any significant difference in combat when I've tried this, but you can use it to interfere with certain scripts (e.g. people guarding doors like Keith Wright). Beer and Booze also cause cows to fall over, but the usefulness of this is limited.</blockquote>

  The Bag is responsible for an inventory bug which sometimes lets you keep items that are really supposed to disappear from your inventory, depending on which script command is being used to remove them. Items are "protected" if they're below the Bag in your inventory, apparently because the engine can't handle the container item type properly. Ways you can exploit this include giving Cornelius' watch to both him and Farrel and get xp for both those quests, getting upgraded weapons from Algernon or Skeeter while keeping the originals, and having Myron concoct any number of Stimpaks or Super Stimpaks from the same ingredients. If you like to carry the Bag around but don't like to cheat, make sure the Bag is always near the bottom of your inventory, or make sure to relocate ingredients and weapons to the top before making chems, upgrades etc. The bug doesn't affect money or items kept in the Bag. Finally an observation from Sean Meskill regarding Algernon: "When I requested the fuel upgrade, I had a pack of 5 fuel units under my Bag. When I got my upgrade, I had a pack of 10 blue fuel above and a pack of 10 red fuel beneath."</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The four medical supplies items will vanish after use if you fail a separate skill check. Applying them to a healthy subject will cause time to pass and they may be used up. Finally, the Paramedics Bag appears to be bugged; at any rate it doesn't provide a skill bonus to normal healing.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  The bonuses of items such as Lockpicks and Tools vary between scripts. Though they are usually +20% and +40% respectively, they might be +10% and +50% in one script while another treats them alike. All normal doors have the +20%/+40% bonuses anyway. Also not all scripts will allow you to substitute either or both bonus items for using the actual skill. The Super Tool Kit in particular is used in so few scripts that I'd settle for a Tool if anything.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Geiger Counters and Motion Sensors use up "charges" each time you turn them on, but don't seem to care much about how long you leave them on after that (the Geiger Counter will lose a charge if you leave it on and rest for several days). They'll turn off automatically if you move to another map.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  You'll find there's a bartering bug related to Geiger Counters: some of them cannot be bartered away no matter what kind of offer you make although they have a cash value displayed in the bartering interface as usual (kind of like trying to sell armed Dynamite or a lit Flare). It could have to do with the fact that traders will refuse to accept Geiger Counters whose batteries have run out, although this bug affects items with charges as well, and you can always sell Motion Sensors even if they don't have any charges.</blockquote>

  For Valerie, the first price listed is the "normal" price and the second with a CH- or Barter-based discount (beware the Cattle Prod bug). Buster will only perform one upgrade. As noted in the walkthrough, Skeeter and Eldridge won't charge for upgrades if you have Barter at 91% or more. Algernon in Eldridge's basement will perform all upgrades, and for no charge. That pretty much makes all the others completely pointless, so what were they thinking?</blockquote>

  All upgrades will be fully loaded on delivery, so remove any ammo before turning over items to be upgraded. If you hand in an amount of Flamethrower Fuel less than 10, you'll still get 10 Flamethrower Fuel MKII (you can use a Flamethrower to divide the ammo into packs of 5 and thus double the amount, in case you're really that crazy about Flamethrower Fuel).</blockquote>

  <h4>Bugs</h4>

  Here I'm going to list a few bugs uncovered during play or testing. Well-known, localized bugs that affect gameplay are generally covered in the area walkthrough. Apart from these there are countless minor text mistakes, typos, dialogue glitches, continuity errors, AI glitches, scenery transparency issues and other inconsequential bugs. While for a game of this size and complexity that's sort of understandable, lots of remaining scripting bugs would be extremely easy to correct, and many fixes in the patch either didn't work or introduced new problems that are just as bad. More pre-patch bugs that are not listed here or in the walkthrough can be found in the patch notes.<br><br>

  Game shutting down completely and returning to Windows as I stepped on the exit grid of the Gecko power plant. Random instances of spawning Windows error messages and then shutting down during combat.<br><br>

  Buttons on the game display replaced by black squares and becoming unusable: the skilldex button on the main screen, and the sleep button in the Pipboy. This is actually a warning sign that the "too many items" bug is coming up (see below).<br><br>

  Car disappearing from the game after I went to Modoc and clicked Bed &amp; Breakfast on the town map. Car disappearing without warning as I was travelling on world map. "Car outta fuel" location appearing randomly on the world map, or not at all, after I ran out of fuel. And I had thought all the car bugs were out of the patched version...<br><br>

  Car disappearing after Big Jesus teleported me to the Stables. When I left the Stables by stepping on the exit grid I was in the car on the world map, but whenever I would enter a location the car would not be there. I managed to work around this by driving around the map, avoiding all random encounters and thus avoiding actually ending up on a map sans car, until I ran out of fuel, whereupon the car mercifully showed up on the "Car outta fuel" map. Phew!<br><br>

  Caravan troubles: leaders disappearing, caravans aborting, character teleported to a location on the world map corresponding to some other trade route than the one travelled. Many have reported generally buggy behaviour from caravans and caravan leaders on town maps.<br><br>

  When you load a game saved in combat mode, party members or other critters (e.g. the Shi guards) may think they're engaged in combat with you even if they weren't hostile previously. Party members attack for one turn then return to normal (i.e. same as if you hit them with explosives). Neutrals should calm down if you manage to end combat, or you could just load again and try to move away from anyone that looks irritable.<br><br>

  When I tried to search a "stuff" container on a table, my character picked up the stuff, which disappeared from the screen (leaving an empty table) and instead turned into a Geiger Counter in my inventory. The Geiger Counter couldn't be used, though, and if dropped it would look like floating stuff. Eventually I sold it to a shop.<br><br>

  While playing I suddenly died of radiation sickness for no apparent reason (the message could be glimpsed as the screen faded to white). When I reloaded and rested or travelled for a certain time I'd die again, always at the same moment and no matter where I was. I wasn't radiated at all before then, and Rad-X offered no protection. I loaded another game saved only a short while before the first, and rested. At the moment I would have died in the other save, the message window stated "You feel very nauseous", but I didn't die. Nor was I radiated in any way. I continued playing from there and nothing seemed different. It's possible that this bug also existed in <i>Fallout</i>.<br><br>

  Once I used Steal on a gecko in the Arroyo wilderness. The gecko moved away as my character performed the steal animation, and I ended up trying to steal things from a Broc Flower that occupied the space where the gecko had been.<br><br>

  When I encountered "A Den caravan fighting a Vault City caravan", half of the VC caravan guards thought they were fighting for the Den side, while the Den guards refused to take part in the battle at all until it was over, at which point they attacked me instead. It appears to be normal behaviour for Den caravans that the guards and the caravan master aren't on the same team. Several other encounters feature similar behaviour, e.g. farmers not being on the same team as their children, VC patrols not being on the same team as their dogs, and slavers not being on the same team as <i>their</i> dogs.<br><br>

  In the Cat's Paw in New Reno there's a wall you can run right through, and in the Hubologist base there are several. In one of Bishop's closets you can step into the wall and access shelves in the next room, but not actually cross into it. Sometimes when you're running along a wall or cutting across a southern corner, it looks like you're running inside the wall. This doesn't seem to be a purely visual effect; if your timing is right you can drop an item "in the wall".<br><br>

  Boxing names aren't set properly for stupid characters. Another one the readme claims was fixed.<br><br>

  I attacked someone in Modoc while Laddie was following me, thus turning him hostile but not making him stop following me. I left Modoc and shortly thereafter got the Frank Horrigan encounter. As soon as the encounter began Laddie started attacking me, breaking my paralysis and allowing me to run up and stand between the farmers and the people with machine guns as the scripted sequence continued. Presently the soldiers fired and the family was killed, leaving me and Laddie completely unharmed. Next, the dead farmers got to their feet, only to fall down again as soon as combat ended. Horrigan and the soldiers walked away as usual, but remained standing on the map a little way north, completely unresponsive. I tried attacking Horrigan but couldn't inflict any damage, and the soldiers didn't like it much. This time they didn't miss with their Vindicator Miniguns, either.<br><br>

  Lo Pan stayed in the ring in San Francisco after you first see the Dragon punching him. This apparently meant there was a problem with getting his test fights and challenging him. My ingenious solution was to start the Dragon's test fights, knocking the first opponent unconscious, ending combat and talking to Lo Pan. This had the effect that Lo Pan teleported out to the ringside while I was essentially fighting two (and frequently more) opponents at the same time. All kinds of crazy stuff broke out (including multiple crashes as well as the normal fight bugs). In one scenario I finished the Dragon's goons without having completed Lo Pan's set of fights and was teleported outside; I could then go and talk to Lo Pan who was still standing outside the ring (supposedly watching me fight his men in it), and challenge him personally. Once we were in the ring he would not move, his (and the Dragon's) remaining men would attack, and I found that if I hit Lo Pan it would turn the Shi outside the ring hostile (they started beating on my NPCs). In another scenario I ended up inside the ring with my Advanced Power Armor and Super Sledge. Eventually I managed to set it up so that I finished both test fights at the same time; depending on who of Lo Pan and the Dragon could work his script upon me first, I would either end up in the ring with Lo Pan (i.e. eternally stuck) or in the house with the Dragon, who'd then ask me to challenge Lo Pan (who was in the ring). Still, I'd get those 16,000 xp, so I continued playing from there. Feeling a bit experimental after all that, I saved and challenged the Dragon to a fight, then knocked <i>him</i> unconscious, talked to Lo Pan, challenged him and killed him. Then the Dragon woke up and gave me my 3000 xp for that, largely unconcerned with the fact that we were now both stuck. (Even if I'd killed them both and been sent back to the house, there'd have been no one to give me any reward.)<br><br>

  It's possible to get stuck between the forcefields in the Hubologist base, with guards hovering outside preventing you from leaving combat to disable the forcefields using Repair. If you have a ranged weapon, though, it's possible to fire through the forcefields.<br><br>

  After I killed Fred and reported back to Rebecca my character got hit for 400 points of damage. It seems that a piece of unused script related to getting killed by Dr Troy was triggered in some mysterious way. At another time I had increased my HP for testing purposes and was hit for 279 points of damage from out of the blue, sliding a little along the floor and picking myself up again.<br><br>

  If Grisham is killed in the Slag fight, he'll still be in Modoc, and if he's killed again, he leaves no corpse.<br><br>

  From the patch readme: "Fixed bug causing some Melchior crashes related to fire geckos not being able to hit their target." This can still happen with the patch. When testing the bottleneck strategy for this fight I also experienced a bug where everyone stopped animating when attacking or being hit, and combat messages would simply appear instantly. This eventually caused the computer to lock up.<br><br>

  Some large bookcases are technically two pieces of scenery (as pointed out by Kahgan, the reason for this is so the whole bookcase can display properly with regard to perspective), and if you happen to click the wrong one your character fiddles with it only to generate a message saying it's too heavy to pick up.<br><br>

  In rare cases when a critter is killed it doesn't do its death animation, but remains frozen in a standing or taking damage frame. (For the thieves in the Den, this is the norm rather than the exception.) Since the game still considers the body to be flat on the floor, any scenery is drawn on top of it and may appear to be floating. If a moving critter dies from a Super Stimpak overdose it may complete its walking animation and then remain standing - all the while being dead and lootable.<br><br>

  I finally encountered the explosives-corrupt-the-save-slot bug (or something that looked like it), fortunately during testing. I set three charges in a Bag to kill Buster, left the map (whereupon they should all have gone off and at least one did), re-entered and saved. When I later tried to load it didn't work.<br><br>

  Sometimes when you enter a random encounter cave, one or more critters are walking around inside the walls.<br><br>

  Unnamed Wrights will address you as a Prizefighter if you're a Made Man for them and vice versa.<br><br>

  Loading the game under a roof in Navarro will sometimes leave the roof visible, with your character surrounded by the usual globe of transparency until you leave the building.<br><br>

  Stupid characters should have been able to get one training session from the Dragon/Lo Pan in SF, but this is prevented by bad scripting.<br><br>

  The reserve movement function, which worked somewhat awkwardly in <i>Fallout</i>, now doesn't seem to work at all. Holding down Shift to walk always works, though.<br><br>

  Many sinks in the game (for instance, the one in the small house near your car in the NCR bazaar) are equipped with the random encounter traveller script; you can tell if an examination yields the message "A traveler". There is no other effect, though. In <i>Fallout</i> sinks had a sink script by default, which corresponds technically to the traveller script in <i>Fallout 2</i>.<br><br>

  I stole from the giant stone head and got hit for around 7,000 points of damage, slid onto the exit grid and ended up on the world map. After travelling around cheerfully for a while I entered a random encounter and promptly expired from my wounds.<br><br>

  There's a general script bug concerning those few critters that make use of the game's detailed reaction system. The reaction routine calculates a value based on your CH, karma, reputations and so on, but it doesn't automatically convert this value into the set of reaction levels that's checked by the scripts. This is done if you hit a node in dialogue which modifies reaction, but in some cases it never happens, meaning these critters default to a neutral reaction. Among other things this disables a possibility for stupid characters to get permission from Ken Lee to use the computer by getting a good reaction (not that they actually could have).<br><br>

  A few critters have gender problems. The female super mutant in Broken Hills uses a male critter prototype. The Navarro sergeant uses a female one. Spore plants and floaters are called "he" instead of "it".<br><br>

  A few critters haven't been assigned scripts, e.g. a couple of Rebecca's casino guards (those in the corners nearest to the street) and one of the NCR slavers (the one in the lower left corner). You can attack and kill them and no one will care.<br><br>

  If you talk to a patrolling slaver guard in NCR from outside the fence, he thinks you're trespassing and the slavers turn hostile.<br><br>

  Going into the Redding tunnels through the mining camp well takes you to the same spot as if you'd entered through the grave.<br><br>

  If you load the game on the Modoc entrance map with Miria or Davin in your party, they will teleport into their rooms, then come running back to you.<br><br>

  The Den bulletin board was fixed in the patch so that you can't use it during combat (which is bad), but the Klamath one wasn't.<br><br>

  If you finish Rebecca's first quest, the second appears in your Pipboy even if you don't ask for more work.<br><br>

  At the Ghost Farm there's a second trapdoor above and to the left of the normal exit from the cavern. This one is visible from the beginning and you can flip it open, but using the manhole beneath it doesn't do anything.<br><br>

  If a stupid character talks to the gate guard in Navarro for the first time and you choose the top option twice, the talking head disappears for the duration of the next sample.<br><br>

  On the developed Vault 15 map, not only can you walk through three of the walls of the outhouse, but above it you can also walk inside the cliff wall and continue all the way to the exit grid on the right.<br><br>

  If you kill Liz in Broken Hills, her shop inventory will somewhat weirdly be teleported to her corpse from the nearby table. Maybe in her death throes she crashed into it and everything fell down on her.<br><br>

  When Hank in Gecko checks you for the Hydroelectric Part he actually looks to see if you have a Crowbar in your inventory.<br><br>

  You may get various forms of inappropriate dialogue from the Brain after giving him Cheezy Poofs if you have fixed but not optimized the plant.<br><br>

  If you keep changing your mind when Jacob first gives you the Explosive Switch, he'll continually give you more of them. They're not worth anything, though.<br><br>

  Myron initially has an ammo cartridge in his active item slot instead of his gun.<br><br>

  You can repeatedly tell Dr Henry in NCR to hand over his papers even after completing the quest; moreover, if you fail a Speech check and he shouts for the guards, nothing happens.<br><br>

  Outside the Hubologist base the sun always shines, literally, because of a bug with the light setting.<br><br>

  I attacked a guard in the Steel Palace, a red guard fired back and hit one of the blue guards, causing all the lab techs nearby to come running and attack the red guard, while I sought refuge behind a forcefield and the blue guards did nothing. The red guard was knocked unconscious by a lucky critical and was then beat up ineffectually for a long time by the techs. Once he woke up and ran away, he and a fellow red guard were swiftly executed by the blue guards carrying Gauss Rifles.<br><br>

  Hal will have a green outline from the moment he appears in NCR and will be on your side if you start a fight against the police. The same is true for the guy who rewards you for the cattle drive in Redding.<br><br>

  If you have sex with random encounter trappers, the game doesn't increase the sex counter. Conversely, if you get knife training from Little Jesus the sex procedure is called once too many, regardless of whether you're supposed to have sex with him at all.<br><br>

  One of Myron's level up messages contains a percent sign which looks as if it was really meant as such (he is referring to his skill values). However, the text parser apparently interprets it as a variable and prints some hexadecimal value in its place, and people have believed this was part of the joke.<br><br>

  There are many places in the game where floating messages from the player are not adjusted for stupid characters, e.g. when exorcizing Anna and finding the Wrench.<br><br>

  Killing children in random encounters raises your karma instead of lowering it, though it works as normal with respect to Childkiller.<br><br>

  Funny thing: I walloped Cassidy with the Super Sledge, sending him sliding face down across half the screen. Having done so I ran for an exit grid. Leaving the map and ending combat created a small window where the unconscious Cassidy's Stimpak use was triggered, along with an accompanying float: "Thanks, friend."<br><br>

  Sometimes a missed grenade will explode in a crowd of people and not do any damage.<br><br>

  According to the manual there should be a bonus to your Critical Chance carrying over from your attack roll, but there is no such thing.<br><br>

  Saving in the middle of combat can cause critters to sequence before you upon reloading, effectively giving them an extra turn.<br><br>

  If you left-click in combat on an unlootable unconscious or dead critter your character will move up to it, and while next to it you will use up 3 AP with each click, as if you were actually accessing a lootable corpse. Clicking and holding to select the "look" icon functions properly.<br><br>

  You can use First Aid Kits and Doctor's Bags on scenery or containers. Sometimes you'll get messages like "Tree looks healthy already", sometimes there'll actually be a skill check with corresponding messages and xp gain, though nothing happens to the object.<br><br>

  Critters can make combat floats when hit by attacks that knock them unconscious. Do they quip threateningly while falling to the ground, or what?<br><br>

  Almost every door and container script in the game has code for trapping them and prying them open, but this is inaccessible. You can trap graves, though, for very little gain, and you can also use Dynamite to trap the cage doors in the NCR bazaar and then take damage from the trap by using the door - without any visual or aural cue - even though you can't actually budge it.<br><br>

  Party members with a talking head show the Shady Sands background in Vault City and NCR, not the adobe background used by Lynette and Tandi. The Vault City vault also uses the Shady Sands background. Only one background is used in Klamath no matter if you're in the woods, in town, or in the rat caves. When you stop in the desert it uses whichever background was used last. In Navarro, the backgrounds above and below ground are mixed up.<br><br>

  It's possible to disrupt the Modoc wedding with explosives. After you get caught by Grisham, grab a Dynamite, run to the chapel and drop it before he can catch up with you, then talk to him. It's somewhat amusing if you manage to time the bomb so it goes off after Jo asks if there are any objections to the wedding. However, if you leave the map before the ceremony is over you'll get the NPC immobility bug and become an enemy of Modoc, even if the explosion didn't damage any of the townspeople. You could also set the Dynamite before sex so that it goes off during the first fade-out. If Miria/Davin dies, Grisham will just stand in the doorway staring, but again when you take off this counts as running from the wedding.<br><br>

  You can't scroll the screen far enough to take advantage of weapon ranges around 40 or above. For instance, this often makes it hard or impossible to fire at the raiders without them firing back with their range 35 FN FALs.<br><br>

  If an NPC is lying down when combat ends, they will stay flagged as fallen; you can tell if they become stuck in moving animation frames when standing still. The next time you are in combat they'll get up at a cost of 3 AP. Goris is especially vulnerable to this as not only can he be frozen in an improper frame, but you can get him to walk around without his cloak outside of combat mode.<br><br>

  If you kill a party member with a 0-damage critical, their corpse will follow you from map to map while undergoing various stages of decay, and may even perform fidgets and floats as if they were still alive. They shouldn't still take up a party slot, though. Historically this has been observed for the pariah dog, the NPC that ends up being killed by the Chosen One more often than any of the others.<br><br>

  If you're overloaded you cannot trade away gear if the remaining load is still over your carrying capacity.<br><br>

  A member of a neutral team that accidentally hits you or an NPC may decide that this means you are an enemy, even if there is no retaliation.<br><br>

  Below this point I'll mention a few bugs that I haven't seen personally and for which there are no known causes, but which have been reported consistently enough.<br><br>

  When you enter random encounter caves with lots of robbers, these may all run up to you and try to punch you instead of equipping their deadly Gauss Rifles.<br><br>

  All shops in the game may at some point cease to restock, apparently because the game timer goes out of whack and jumps to some negative value. This means shopkeepers will have no inventory at all if you visit them for the first time after the bug sets in, including random encounter merchants and trappers. Accounts vary slightly in details, but a common factor seems to be that the bug only strikes after a long time of playing (some 6 years or more of game time). Reported side effects include timer-dependent features breaking down (like waiting forever for the Dragon's next training session), character age becoming fixed, and the Pipboy losing track of special dates.<br><br>

  Some have reported being stuck in the Military Base after the elevators stopped working. There's nothing in the scripts that indicate this could happen; once you fix the generator the power should always stay on and the elevators should remain functional. In version 1.0 you had the option of going into the deeper levels of the base from the world map (this was also removed for SAD levels and, for some reason, the Shi palace in San Francisco), but this shouldn't matter either since you can't ever get down there in the first place without previously having restored power.<br><br>

  Some people find that the NCR cops attack even after they put away their weapons, or accuse them of being armed when they aren't. The cops can go hostile without it being immediately obvious, but they shouldn't accuse you of being armed if you actually aren't, or have a delayed reaction if you don't run from them while still holding a weapon.

  <h4>The too many items bug</h4>

  I don't know exactly how it works technically, but what happens is that late in the game, if you have too many (different) items in one location, this will eventually corrupt maps. The number of items in question includes what you and your NPCs are carrying, the items on critters and in containers on the map (including shops), plus the stuff in your car no matter if it's present or not. The bug triggers upon leaving an area, and means that next time you try to enter that map, your computer will lock up completely. Many people have reported this behaviour; you'll notice how the "orbiting rocket" mouse pointer shows up on the screen, but doesn't animate. The hard drive might buzz for a while then fall silent. Depending on your system you may have to turn your computer off entirely. If you reload the game the same thing will happen again eventually, or right away if the save includes the broken state of the map you're trying to enter (but since a map goes bad only when you leave it, the current map of each save will never be corrupted, thankfully). Maps will become corrupted more frequently as you continue to play and amass items, making the game nearly (or literally) unplayable towards the end.<br><br>

  The simplest way to prevent this from happening is to avoid carrying around quest items which you have no further use of. If you want to keep them, don't store them in your trunk but in some accessible container on a map where there are no shops, or where there are not too many items anyway. If you want to be doubly safe, avoid selling too many different items in one place. If you're not in the habit of hoarding items, this will probably not be an issue.<br><br>

  If a map in a saved game has been corrupted, there is no way (known to me, at least) to restore it, but you can work around the problem. What you must do is find the corresponding file from an earlier save and replace the bad file with it. For instance, San Francisco Chinatown, which is the map where this might well happen to you the first time (two big shops), is "sfchina.sav" - use the <nobr>Ctrl-R</nobr> trick to find the right map if you're in doubt. Critters and items on the map will revert to what they were in the previous save, and local variables may change (possibly interfering with dialogue or allowing you to repeat certain actions), but global variables such as quest status as well as the contents of your car are stored elsewhere and so are not affected. NPCs (including the trunk) left standing on the broken map will only be present if they were in the save you got the replacement file from. (You may also on the "fixed" map encounter duplicates of party members left behind elsewhere, and you can kill these and take any stuff that the real NPC was carrying, but this would be cheating.)<br><br>

  At this time it's not perfectly clear which circumstances lead up to the freezing bug. It's been theorized that having too many Pipboy files in your status screen could be the cause of the bug, since it can lead to the "black button" bug and would be consistent with the fact that it strikes after visiting the Military Base with its holodisks. It's also possible that there are multiple causes for the black button bug (which has even been observed in the original <i>Fallout</i> as a result of excessive item hoarding), but that only in the "too many items" case does it go on to the freezing bug; to my knowledge there are no reports to the contrary.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star4.gif" alt="a yellow star" align="left">
  Daniel Valle may have found a way to circumvent the problem based on the theory that the corruption bug only follows the black button bug: "I noticed that the skilldex button going black happened <i>only</i> after I opened the Pipboy and checked out the status screen to see my missions and logs. Opening the Pipboy's primary screen or alarm clock did not cause this. My solution has been to not look at the status screen. If I really had to do so, I would quicksave and check it out, then I'd have to shut down the game and start it up again, because once the skilldex button's gone black it will stay black, even if you load save games from Arroyo, which could possibly corrupt maps even early on in the game. So far it has worked well on two games I have already beat and one I am still playing. Truly, I don't know what triggers the problem or its true cause, but if this keeps the game from locking up and corrupting maps then it will have to do." Nimrod adds to this: "I tend to travel light and not hoard items, but I can say with sureness that the evil number of Pipboy entries is twelve. I've paid close attention to this in <i>Fallout</i> and <i>Fallout 2</i> and it's the same number in both - eleven is fine, twelve and you instantly hit problems. I should note that I've never had a map crash on me due to this problem, but I get all the black boxes where buttons should be."</blockquote>

  <h4>How to finish the game in half an hour (if you hurry up)</h4>

  Start a new character. Let's call him "Road Runner", 'cause this will be a fast one. Stats: good IN (but not 10), good AG and PE (for running from random encounters), not too lousy ST or CH, tag Speech, Steal and Barter. The rest doesn't matter. Run through the Temple of Trials as fast as you can, talk Cameron out of fighting. Leave Arroyo right away ("Meep meep!" Vrooom) and move due south-southeast. You should be able to run from anything you happen to encounter.<br><br>

  Once you arrive in San Fransisco at the bottom of the map you must acquire some equipment: 10-17 Super Stimpaks, 2 Psycho and 1 Power Armor. To facilitate this, steal Gauss Rifles and H&amp;K G11s from the guards in the shops and the punks on the tanker, also steal the money off the shopkeepers. You can steal Super Stimpaks from Dr Fung as well. The stores on the tanker have Super Stimpaks and Psycho. If the shops don't have what you want at first, rest 4 days then leave the map and return.<br><br>

  When you have the stuff, go to the Steel Palace and kill Ken Lee using 10 Super Stimpaks. Go to the Hubologist base and the AHS-9. Now save, use the 2 Psycho (reloading if you get addicted), then talk to the AHS-9. Rest for six hours until your IN returns to normal and put a few of your many skill points into Speech. Go to the tanker and set off for the Enclave.<br><br>

  Take the stairs to the detention area (here you would be attacked if not for the Power Armor), go down again. Traverse the maze, going into the side room to the right for the G.E.C.K. and to the left for two Super Stimpaks if needed, then go down the stairs. Find the President, kill him with 7 Super Stimpaks (each of the guards nearby has one if you don't have enough), take the Presidential Access Key. Go to the stairs at the top of the map, go down, find the scientist at the bottom of this map, tell him to shut down the reactor, then go up, run to the newly opened emergency stairs, climb them, and leave the barracks to the west. Talk to Sergeant Granite until he agrees to take on Horrigan. Go west, keep to the bottom of the screen, use the computer and activate counter insurgency. Stand back and watch Horrigan get killed in a few turns by the turrets and soldiers. Open the door and step out. Finished!

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Larry Eggleston Jr. used roughly the same method and managed to finish the game without saving in under twenty minutes, killing Ken Lee with Plastic Explosives instead of Super Stimpaks.</blockquote>

  <h4>How to find and use the Holy Hand Grenade part 1</h4>

  (Or, how the village Elder woke up one day to a surprise of decent magnitude.)<br><br>

  Press <nobr>Ctrl-R</nobr> in the starting options menu. Choose the map named "rndholy2.map". You're now on the vorpal rat map. You can't do anything in this mode, so save the game and exit by pressing <nobr>Ctrl-R</nobr> again. Now load the game you just saved. Things are back to "normal"! The rat will enter combat mode and run at you, but don't worry, it won't actually attack. Go into the cave. Open the chest and search it for... one Holy Hand Grenade! 300-500 damage, it says. Sweet. Exit the cave, save again, and try out the grenade on the rat and Brotherhood knights. If you manage to hit the rat with the grenade it will inflict 9990 damage in addition to its normal damage, and the rat will die. Arthur won't offer any new dialogue, though. Reload the game where you had the grenade and run to the exit grid on the right. You'll find yourself on the world map south of Arroyo. Head there, click past the vault suit cutscene and head on up to the Elder's tent, or Hakunin's, or whatever you prefer. Hello, I found a high-tech gadget for the village, catch! "Arroyo Elder was critically hit for 714 hit points in a forceful blow. Arroyo Elder was killed." Oh, you think?

  <h4>How to find and use the Holy Hand Grenade part 2</h4>

  The second hand grenade encounter was indeed supposed to be in the game, and only disabled by a bug in the encounter script. Unlike the vast majority of bugs this one is relatively easily fixed, however, since the script in question exists in a decompiled state and can be made to recompile automatically when you run the game. One such fix was released by TeamX which also increased the relative probability of finding the encounter slightly. Here's how you can implement the most basic version of the bugfix yourself:

  <ol>
  <li>Use Fallout 2 DAT explorer or a similar program to extract the file Worldmap.txt from Master.dat on the CD (it's in the data folder).
  </li><li>Put this file in Fallout2\data\data on your hard drive. Telling DAT explorer to unpack the file into Fallout2\data will accomplish this.
  </li><li>Open the file with a text editor and exchange all instances of the string "(372)" with "(614)" (the parentheses are important).
  </li><li>Optionally replace "Encounter, Enc" with "Encounter,Enc" and "(616)" with "(617)" if you want to fix the Cafe of Broken Dreams repopping bug at the same time.
  </li><li>Run the game and play as usual, starting a new game or loading an old one.
  </li></ol>

  And here's how it would have looked in the Encounters section:<br><br>

  <b>King Arthur's Knights fighting a rat (10):</b> (Vorpal Rat Cave) This is a mountain encounter. To get it you must first have encountered King Arthur (but not necessarily talked to him), hence the level requirement. What happens is that as a soon as you enter the map, the knights and rat enter combat mode and have at each other. If you do nothing, the rat will sometimes kill the knights, though they often manage to get in an instant kill critical first. If the rat lives, it'll wander its lair peacefully as long as you don't attack it. Going into the cave you'll find the Holy Hand Grenade. This weapon will automatically kill the rat if you manage to hit it (which is worth 7,500 xp, so I can't think of a much better use for it). Any surviving knights will remain on the map afterwards and none of them has anything to say to you.

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Even if you killed some or all of the knights in the first encounter, they'll all be here and not be hostile towards you. I'd kill them again - they each carry 200 or 300 MFC on this map.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  Using the Holy Hand Grenade on the rat may lock up the game. If this happens to you, try killing it with aimed shots to the eyes and save the grenade for something else.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
  If you have any NPCs one of them will become "trapped" in the car as you arrive on the map. They'll be freed if you go into the cave.</blockquote>

  <blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
  Another Rock for hoarding! Wahoo. Or in the immortal words of Rock-in-a-sock: "Geez, what are you, some kind of non-rock collector?"</blockquote>

  <h4>Unfinished business</h4>

  You may think <i>Fallout 2</i> is a big enough game as it is, but the designers were aiming to make it even bigger. There are lots and lots of things, great and small, that didn't make it into the final product, and in many places it shows in different ways. Such things that had to be omitted may include, but are probably not at all limited to the stuff listed here, some of which has been mentioned in the walkthrough. (One or two of these may just be rumours, though.)

  <ul>
  <li>A Klamath quest to expose the Duntons as cattle rustlers using the Radscorpion Limbs.
  </li><li>The second encounter with King Arthur and his knights as described above.
  </li><li>Sulik's sister, whose absence has spawned one of the most persistent and variform net rumours about this game. According to designer Chris Avellone it was never even decided where in the game she was going to appear.
  </li><li>A second tribal village (tentatively named Primitive Village), home of Sulik and situated on the coast between Arroyo and Navarro.
  </li><li>An Abbey world map location north of Gecko, featuring monks hoarding pre-war wisdom. This is also where you'd have run into Ian from the original <i>Fallout</i> - funny how many people from back then managed to live through those 80 years.
  </li><li>An extensive underground base (the Environmental Protection Agency) west of New Reno, with up to seven levels, featuring all kinds of high-tech stuff, artificial intelligences, weapons and items. Presumably this is what Myron alludes to when he mentions pre-war bases.
  </li><li>Diplomatic characters would have been able to beat the raiders by talking to Shadow-Who-Walks and making him leave their employ.
  </li><li>Putting the kids in the Den in an orphanage (possibly run by Mom), with the beneficial side effect of the player not having to risk being pickpocketed any more. Also killing Metzger and telling Karl to return to Modoc should have had quest entries.
  </li><li>A quest to retrieve a corpse stolen by the Hubologists from the Shi, as hinted by the existence of such an item and a log note in the Shi database.
  </li><li>Going to the Enclave using the vertibird in Navarro and/or going to Navarro using the vertibird in the desert transaction.
  </li><li>Use of the Red and Yellow Reactor Keycards in the Enclave reactor room.
  </li><li>Use of the Heart Pills to cover up the Westin murder.
  </li><li>A Shi quest tied in to the EPA, related to the ending where the Shi get their butts kicked by a sentient plant.
  </li><li>The interior of the Hubologist space shuttle and three endings where the Hubologists kill themselves in different ways by means of the shuttle.
  </li><li>Lenny would have been able to turn into a "glowing" ghoul from drinking radioactive beverages. This probably spawned the rumour that you can make the ghouls in the Harp glow by buying them enough booze.
  </li><li>An additional twist to the Lynette-Westin holodisk exchange where the player could blackmail them with knowledge of their underhanded connection.
  </li><li>A good ending for the deathclaws of Vault 13, where the Pack expands peacefully into the surrounding territory. According to John Deiley who designed Vault 13 this was scrapped because the Enclave plot necessitated the slaughter of the deathclaws.
  </li><li>A good ending for Vault City and Gecko; well, actually two endings, one for each town. The good ending for Gecko which revolves around Gordon's "greed is good" scheme is only inaccessible because of a bug.
  </li><li>Two VC endings where Vault City is razed and one Gecko ending where Vault City invades Gecko.
  </li><li>One Broken Hills subplot with Chad the corrupt caravan leader and another concerning the mutagenic serum.
  </li><li>Poking through the game files one can discover many details and features that didn't seem to make it into the game. For instance, there are images for each specific karma level, a Virgin reputation and "Tragic" and alcohol addiction; named critters that are not in the game and earlier versions of existing ones; an Arroyo exile named Kaga repeatedly trying to kill the Chosen One in special encounters; sound files for endings for the Elder, Marcus, Harold and the President; a "Li'l Chemist" kit allowing you to mix chemicals; implied uses for "useless" items such as the Ball Gag, Marked Cards and Radscorpion Limbs; a village outside Vault City whose inhabitants are trying to avoid being turned into "servants"; Merk stealing stuff from your car in NCR; getting to the SAD by finding a map in Sam Pritchard's grave (prevented by a scripting bug); getting the location of the SAD from the traveller encounter (prevented by another scripting bug); giving Jet to Fannie in Redding and eventually having her die of an overdose; the robots in the SAD going to the repair bay for maintenance and repair bots replacing killed robots with new ones; Mr. Cheater; recruiting Dr Jones in Vault 15 as an NPC; a food system; the Pipe Rifle as a "Springer Rifle" loaded with Rocks (!); and more.
  </li><li>A few extra movies (e.g. meeting Gruthar, the desert transaction and getting the car).
  </li><li>Lots of details and options that were disabled by scripting errors or engine issues, for instance: being able to finish the spleen quest by assassinating Dr Wong within a day after his refusal to give you the spleen; the possibility of crippled limbs resulting from falling down in the Ghost Caves or being expelled from the Modoc toilet; Rebecca attacking you if you're a Childkiller; gaining a permanent Agility bonus after sleeping with Miss Kitty; the Hintbook boosting your stats and HP; and others.
  </li><li>A Phazer (sic) at the scene of the shuttle crash.
  </li><li>A boatload of engine updates (ranging from very dumb to very cool) related to critter AI, interface, mechanics and features were suggested but never implemented, due to lack of time, impracticality, or incompatibility with existing code.
  </li></ul>

  <h4>Things I won't add to the guide</h4>

  <ul>
  <li>Karma and reputation changes: more work than it's worth.
  </li><li>Monster lists and stats: if it were <i>Wasteland</i>, I'd do it. RadAngels and Death Anglers! Those were the days.
  </li><li>Detailed weapon and armour stats: you can find these in the game (or using FIME).
  </li><li>Game or combat mechanics: read the... manual.
  </li><li>One-time oddities that happened to other people: have to be reproducible or "known" bugs.
  </li><li>Technical troubleshooting: there are message boards for this.
  </li><li>Unofficial patches: up-to-date and accurate documentation of these should be provided by their creators.
  </li><li>Pop culture reference index: not going there.
  </li></ul>

  <h4>Top 3 stupid <i>Fallout 2</i> rumours</h4>

  <ul>
  <li>"I found Sulik's sister! She was in a random encounter with slavers! No, she was in the slave pens in NCR! No, she was in a mystery location on the world map! No, she was in a locker in the Enclave! Really! She was somewhere but I can't tell you how to get there because I made it all up!"
  </li><li>"I got the second Holy Hand Grenade encounter while playing the game! I'd show you the screenshots but I accidentally formatted my hard drive this morning! Look, a three-headed monkey!"
  </li><li>"The Yellow Reactor Keycard opens the Toxic Caves elevator! I mean, it opens the yellow doors in the Gecko power plant! No, I mean, you use it in Navarro! No, wait, you use it on the reactor in the Enclave! At least I think I did once! Maybe I have a version of the game that no one else has, or maybe I just read it somewhere and you can't blame me for passing it on as truth!"
  </li></ul>

  <h4>Frequently asked questions</h4>

  By now certain questions have qualified for "frequently asked" status, some to a higher degree than others. The ones I particularly reserve the right to ignore in the future are technical questions, gameplay questions with no relation to guide content, and questions whose answers are fully included in the guide. Don't get me wrong - I appreciate feedback, but there's only one of me and many of you, and writing the guide should count as a significant contribution on my part in the first place.

  <ul>
  <li>Q: Where can I find the children patch or utility X?<br>
  A: Try the No Mutants Allowed site or any other fan site with a downloads section. Do a search. Follow some links. Look around. (Note that in earlier versions of the guide I carelessly referred to the children patch as the "kid patch", which seems to have been the main reason why lots of people believed it was nowhere to be found.)
  </li><li>Q: Can you just mail or transfer them to me instead?<br>
  A: No.
  </li><li>Q: Is it OK to mail you with a bunch of screenshots, a save game folder or some other big attachment without prior notice?<br>
  A: No. Even if I hadn't been on a modem and even if it hadn't been basic netiquette to ask first, the chance that I actually have any use for such a file is rather slim. If you have some find or game experience to relate, use words to begin with and we'll take it from there.
  </li><li>Q: I can't find the Bag in Modoc. Can you give me more detailed instructions how to find it?<br>
  A: Not really. If for some reason you simply can't locate the Bag, running a map editor and turning off the scenery should let you mark its location.
  </li><li>Q: I can't trigger event X or I'm having problem Y. What am I doing wrong?<br>
  A: Depending on what X or Y is there could be any number of reasons, really. If I gather from your description of the problem that some guide content is off or incomplete, I'll see if I can adjust it. If not, I'm afraid I don't have the time to elaborate aimlessly on things that are already in the guide or guess at the particulars of someone else's game. Try posing your question on a dedicated message board; the answer is often more simple than it seems.
  </li><li>Q: I can't use item X on critter/scenery Y, it defaults to some other action.<br>
  A: You can't always use an item from the active item slot. If you read the manual (page 35ff) you'll find that you can click and hold on a critter or piece of scenery, then choose the backpack icon, and finally select the item you want to use from inventory.
  </li><li>Q: My NPCs disappeared but it's like they're around invisibly, what's up with that?<br>
  A: Did you get cosy with Mrs Bishop? Check out the New Reno section.
  </li><li>Q: I'm playing the game using mod X, and...<br>
  A: Stop right there. This guide covers official content only. Before you report a problem or a discovery encountered in a modded game, contact the creator of the mod and/or verify that it also happens in an unmodded game. If you report that some bug or feature works differently from what's stated in the guide and it turns out that this is only because of modified content, all the time I spend trying to verify your claim will be entirely wasted.
  </li><li>Q: Is there any way of avoiding or shutting off the 13-year time limit?<br>
  A: There's a number of hacks that effectively halt or reset the game timer. However, they don't actually extend it, so at the time of writing there is no solution that doesn't come with side effects such as disrupting shop and quest timers. This may still be a decent alternative to losing a game that happened to drag on for a while.
  </li><li>Q: Have you written or are you planning guides for <i>Fallout</i> and/or <i>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</i>?<br>
  A: There is already a <i>Fallout</i> guide, as well as a <i>Wasteland</i> guide for those who care about that. I haven't played <i>Fallout Tactics</i> and frankly don't think I will. Needless to say, I won't be touching the ineptly named console title <i>Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel</i> with a 6-foot Sharpened Pole.
  </li><li>Q: Can I host your guide on my <i>Fallout</i> site/general game help site?<br>
  A: Please do, providing that your site is a non-charging, non-profit, non-exclusive enterprise. By that I mean you can't ask users for any sort of fee or service, have them jump through hoops like a registration process, or limit access to the site using some other criteria; moreover, any donations or advertising revenues must be spent entirely on maintaining the site and not on any private benefits. Yes, even if that's just your cola and cat food expenses, as long as this is more than the people who provided your site's content are getting.
  </li><li>Q: Can I translate the guide into strange language X?<br>
  A: Basically, yes; see below for more details.
  </li><li>Q: It says that someone is working on a translation to strange language X, but I haven't seen any result of that. Should I go on and make my own?<br>
  A: It will ultimately have to be your decision, based on what information I have and what you can learn from your own national fan communities, if anything. Until now I haven't really kept track of those who have volunteered to translate, which is somewhat unfortunate, as it has evidently happened that people have quietly abandoned such attempts. In more recent times, others have probably opted to wait for the next guide update after I led them to believe it wouldn't be that long. From this point on I will file away contact information for prospective translators, date-stamp their projects and flag them as pending, ongoing or finished, assuming this information is available to me. If you are actively planning a translation, if you are working on one, if you already finished one, or even if you started on one and then gave up on it, please get in touch.
  </li><li>Q: Why don't you update your guide with the fixes from Killap's unofficial patch?<br>
  A: However highly I think of Killap's work, I won't cover it for the same reason I don't cover any other mods or tweaks. It makes more sense to restrict the guide to official, universal and unchanging content and rely on separate documentation for any add-ons, provided by those who have intimate knowledge of and control over those changes, or by anyone else who would take the time to investigate them. Even if I were to include such information, it would mostly amount to a great number of not really useful notes saying, "Oh, and if you're using Killap's patch, this bug doesn't happen."
  </li><li>Q: I sent you a mail, but you didn't reply.<br>
  A: That happens (and not just to people who write to me about <i>Fallout</i>, believe me). The best way to get a quick response is basically to condense your query/report into a number of simple questions or bullet point notes that I can fire off equally simple replies to. Anything that requires looking into game files ("I did X to Y after doing quest Z and now things have gone all wonky"), or formulating an opinion ("Isn't my 3-page character description the niftiest"), or leaving the <i>Fallout</i> context behind ("My sister is a princess but she's locked up in an African tower or something") could very well end up sitting in my inbox until I feel it would be too awkward to actually do something about it. However, everything that's submitted gets read and duly considered or investigated as appropriate once I get around to updating. You can always send me a reminder if you want confirmation that I received your mail, or if there's something in particular you really want a reply to. That is, unless the reason I didn't reply was one of those listed at the top of this FAQ, in which case you shouldn't send me a reminder because geckos will carry off your fridge.
  </li><li>Q: Now that you don't have to direct people in search of the children patch any longer, what's the most common answer to received queries?<br>
  A: "It's in the guide" - applying to both questions asked and features reported. Use the search function, folks!
  </li><li>Q: This thing must have taken forever to write. Are you insane?<br>
  A: "Devoted" sounds so much better, don't you think? The guide certainly grew into something bigger than I could predict back in October 2001. Testing and playing has eaten up much more time than the actual writing, but along the way I've learned to use various editors and tools to simplify things to the point where in-game testing has almost become a formality. Plus I get lots of appreciative mail. ;)
  </li><li>Q: The Awareness perk isn't <i>that</i> good.<br>
  A: Go away.
  </li></ul>

  <h4>Note on guide translation</h4>

  Since putting out version 1.1 I've been asked by a few people if it's OK for them to translate the guide into other languages, something which would seem to testify to the level of devotion inspired by this game. At the time of writing translations into Hungarian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazilian <i>and</i> European), German, French, Spanish, Slovak, Russian, Finnish and Italian should be planned, under way or finished, and there is also a Chinese adaptation of some sort.<br><br>

  If anyone wants to take on the task of translating the guide, feel free to do so! (Of course, it might be a good idea to drop me a mail in case someone else is already on the job, or just to say hi.) My one condition is that you respect the fact that this is originally my work, which means you should not make arbitrary changes, forget to credit me, or try to make money out of it. Here are a few guidelines:

  <ul>
  <li>I would prefer that you keep the original HTML format and presentation style, although if you desperately want to convert the guide into Word format, RTF, pure text or PDF I won't tell you no.
  </li><li>Please stay as faithful to the original as possible, meaning you shouldn't omit or move about paragraphs or information, work your own opinions into the text, or make "updates" of your own without clearly labelling them as such. Obviously you should feel free to make cosmetic changes, e.g. omit puns that wouldn't make sense in translation or modify and rearrange sentences as dictated by style or grammar.
  </li><li>Add a translation credit at the top of the guide.
  </li><li>Optionally add a "Translator's note" subsection in Addenda above the version history.
  </li><li>Add something distinguishing to the version designation at the top and insert this in the version list, e.g. "V1.3No" if you were translating it into Norwegian. If the number of translations continues to grow, you may have to use more than just one or two letters to avoid ambiguity.
  </li><li>Include your email address somewhere (translator's note, version list, or the copyright notice).
  </li></ul>

  For users of translated versions, please note that I cannot answer any questions about them, react to language-specific error reports, or otherwise act as a go-between. You'll have to direct your queries to the translators, or consult the original. Also any feedback in languages other than Swedish or English will be pretty much wasted on me. :)

  <h4>What's new</h4>

  And now for a list of what's been added or updated in v1.1 of the guide, in no particular order:<br><br>

  Made numerous inconsequential changes for style or clarity, clarified or corrected or added innumerable snippets of information and requirements for quest options (which I won't list here unless they're of special interest), corrected Knife and Molotov Cocktail damage, corrected Psycho duration and elaborated on Psycho and Rad-X duration, added AP cost to the weapons table and rearranged said table slightly, added the radioactivity of Fruit (belated thanks to Zuger) and removed note on "random radiation" which can be attributed to this, adjusted the bonuses of Lockpicks and similar items, added Bess to the NPC list, added some pre-patch notes (Goris, Here and Now, Gecko ghouls, ACE and radiation, getting the car, shop restocking times, getting the Jet quest from Dr Troy, SAD sliding panels), added a way to get to the Stables from New Reno, added a few minor notes in Preparations (e.g. default settings), added note on extra HP per level, added extra info on the mutated toes in the Toxic Caves and Vault City sections, corrected the requirement for Myron to make Super Stimpaks (several people told me my previous assumption was incorrect), downgraded Sharpshooter and added a note
