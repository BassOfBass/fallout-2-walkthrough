  p.
    Sometimes I feel like a magic 8-ball. I just spout random sayings and walk away.

Broken Hills is one of the two mining towns in this game, unique when it comes to the way that humans, ghouls and mutants live together. If you put away your weapons, you can talk to Steve the town greeter and learn a few things. The first time you arrive here in the car, you'll hit poor Lumpy who gives you a reference to a special encounter in <i>Fallout</i>. 

Liz runs the general store. If you have negative karma you can ask her what there is around to kill; if you get a bad reaction and annoy her she won't talk to you at all. Characters with high Steal can attempt to simply pick her table clean. She has some minor stuff in her basement (four containers with weapons, including a Combat Shotgun), but she won't let you go down there to begin with. With a good Sneak skill you can do it anyway (the check is harder at night whether Liz is actually in the room or not). To get into the basement with her permission, go to Phil's place, buy stuff and tip him for a total of $20 (because of a bug the tips aren't deducted from your money), whereupon he reveals the secret of the weapons cache. Return to Liz, ask about the weapons and tell her you heard about them from a reliable source. Then tell her you'll use the weapons on the mutants and she'll let you take them.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If when you ask Liz about the stash you choose the "it's all over town" line, you'll get stuck in dialogue mode. This is a serious bug that happens because the script tries to start a fight when you're still in dialogue. You can press 1 and Esc to exit, but you'll have to shut down the game entirely before you can play normally again. This also happens if you tell her "You" when she asks what you had in mind to kill, or if you fail a Speech check after giving her the "reliable source" line (save often!).</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Liz restocks every 2-4 days, while Bill, Jacob and Holliday all restock every 3 days. For the latter three, prices will be significantly lower (50% in the case of Bill and the doctor) if you ask them to barter in dialogue instead of hitting the barter button. John L. Hunter points out that Liz's table restocks even after she is killed, though you still need Steal 25-30% to access it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|IN&lt;4: Every time you trade with Liz, she takes a tenth of your money afterwards and calls it a "service charge". How's that for charity? Jacob only takes a small "tip". You need IN 2 to ask them to trade, but even if you have IN 1 you can get around this simply by pressing the barter button, which also circumvents the service charge. This means you have to pay their expensive rate, of course, but a stupid character wouldn't get Jacob's cheap rate anyway.</blockquote>

Marcus the mutant sheriff will join your party after you complete quests 1 and 2. You get 1000 xp for this, plus you can always grab his Minigun and stuff if you're not bringing him. 

Talk to Bill if you want to work as a caravan guard on routes to Vault City (on the 21st each month), NCR (on the 11th) and Gecko (on the 1st). These caravan jobs suck compared to the ones in Redding, since you get only $200 per job, plus there are no return caravans, effectively leaving you stranded. For general behaviour of caravans, see Redding. Should Chad get killed or if you abandon a caravan, you don't get paid and there will be no more caravans. If you choose to shovel brahmin crap, you get $100 each time, and after you've done it five times you get the Expert Excrement Expeditor special perk which gives you +5% to Speech and 500 xp. Bill will also sell stuff.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|IN&lt;4: You only get to shovel crap once (need IN 2 for this), so you don't get the perk.</blockquote>

Talk to Doc Holliday and listen to the story of his life. You'll get free healing from him (HP and damaged limbs except for eyes, same NPCs as Dr Troy in Vault City except he'll heal Laddie instead of Dogmeat and K-9), and also learn that he knows a certain Dr Fung in San Francisco, which is useful info. You can also get free healing if you ask what he does and banter a little, but you can only do that once, whereas you can get him to talk about his life over and over again. If for some reason you pay for healing he'll charge between $50 and $300 for each person. He'll sell you Stimpaks and stuff, and takes only half the price if you ask him to trade instead of hitting the barter button.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you have the car you won't be able to ask for party healing if you only have one NPC, but if you get the free healing he'll heal everyone anyway.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|IN&lt;4: Each time you pay for healing it costs $100 but you don't get healed, which is probably a bug (or is this old man really... evil?).</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Only two containers on the western map have anything in them (except for the hidden footlockers, see below): one bookcase in Marcus' house which holds a Rubber Doll, and the small pot outside the house on the top right which holds a Cat's Paw. (Obviously these are for Typhon, along with the Rotgut from the bar.) The containers on the eastern Broken Hills map are <i>all</i> empty - the only item lying around is the Fuzzy Painting in Eric's house. Lazy, lazy level designers!</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
On the subject of "cheating within the workings of the game"... By the exit grid where you arrive in town, position your character between the exit and the the fence to the north, on the hex which is half offscreen. Then click on the other side of the fence and you'll end up there. Now, in the upper left corner of the map you'll find a few footlockers whose contents you can grab if you want to. They contain, from left to right: nothing, Jacob's stock, Holliday's stock and Bill's stock. All of them reset to full every three days, too, even Jacob's after you put him in jail. If the exit grid causes you trouble, instead go directly south, then work your way past the brahmin pen and the houses by clicking on the ground further away on the map. This way you can skirt around the map on the "outside" to reach the footlockers, even bypassing the exit grid on the right. The empty box is actually used for temporarily storing a shopkeeper's usual inventory while you're trading with them. As pointed out by John L. Hunter, you can stuff armed explosives into this box, then run quickly back and talk to a shopkeeper; after you leave dialogue they'll carry the explosives. Could be of interest if you want to try a really crazy assassination technique.</blockquote>

Talk to Typhon in the eastern part of town. Give him a Cat's Paw and wait one hour. Give him a Rubber Doll and wait for three hours. Give him a bottle of Rot Gut and he'll give you a clue as to where his hidden treasure might be. You also gain 2000 xp. The next part is purely optional. Go to the town well and manipulate it. You find the treasure, but it falls down the well, and you're too big to go down there. How appropriate that a small treasure hunter is just nearby! Talk to Micky and he goes down to retrieve... 10,000 Bottle Caps. Useless. And no, you can't get Micky back up again. 

p.
  Dan, the worried spouse, is in the house northeast of the Old Ghouls' Home. Agree to look for his wife (charging him if you want to), then after you've found the dead bodies in quest 2, return to Dan and break the news to him in whichever way you choose for 500 xp. If you're evil, you can take his $500 and then tell him you're not going to look for her after all. This will not make you popular. 

If you talk to the mad Professor in the lab coat, you can take Agility, Perception or Intelligence tests against his artificially smartened radscorpion. Take the AG and PE tests first for 500 xp each. You can match the scorpion with very low stats although you may have to try several times (it's impossible to actually outperform it). It turns out you can't win the IN test because the scorpion "cheats" at chess (or maybe it really is smarter). Time to look elsewhere for guidance. If you go to the field to the north you may notice a talking spore plant trying to draw your attention. Rrright. If you bring a Shovel you can help the plant by moving it to the Old Ghouls' Home for 1000 xp, and the plant will tell you how to beat the scorpion at chess. Return to the doctor and defeat the scorpion for 500 more xp. The scorpion will attack you, but just run away once and end combat and you won't have to kill it. Your party members will, though, if you don't park them somewhere else.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|IN&lt;4: The first time you pass the Agility test the Professor will give you a packet of Mentats. Actually he carries a ton.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you don't kill the scorpion you might want to steal the Spectacles off it. You can even steal its tail! If you want to hear it talk, get caught stealing from it.</blockquote>

You can enter the mine to the north, where several super mutants are standing about. To the right inside the entrance there's a heap of rocks. Place the movement cursor just inside the wall and you'll notice you can go there. You get 1000 xp for discovering this secret area. On the floor is a guy who will get up automatically when you move next to him. Ask him who he is for another 500 xp; if you choose the other line, or if you're stupid, he runs away instead. Get the Uranium Ore from the footlocker. There's another hidden cave near the top right of the map, but it's empty.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|There's an infinite experience bug here... if Stodgers is prevented from leaving the map, you can save and reload, and you'll be able to talk to him again with the same outcome. Saving will make him stop if he's running, as will entering combat mode. Placing an NPC in the narrow passage will ensure that Stodgers can't get anywhere at all, so that you can repeat this as many times as you like. Telling NPCs to wait means they won't take damage from the gas, but also that they won't level up with you if you take advantage of the bug.</blockquote>

Next bring the ore to the white ghoul in the refinery south of the caravan office. You'll have to fork out $1000 but you earn 500 xp. After the ghoul's done (takes a day) he'll offer to buy the ore back for $1500. You can either keep the ore (no use, Harold and Festus in Gecko won't even look at it), let him have it for $1500 and 300 xp, or let him have it for $1000, 1250 xp and some karma. I'd choose the latter.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|There's an infinite money bug here... if you take the extra $500, you can talk to the ghoul over and over again, choosing the same line and gaining $1500 each time. Once you're satisfied, either keep the ore or give it to him (though you can't get any more xp). Real <i>Fallout 2</i> players don't take advantage of poor stupid ghouls in this way.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Some random encounter merchants in the Broken Hills area carry Uranium Ore, so it's possible to do the refining bit without finding Chuck Stodgers in the mine.</blockquote>

<b></b><li><b>Fix the mine's air purifier.</b> 

Go to Zaius in the building next to the mine entrance, agree to go get the spare parts and fix the purifier. If you ask for money you can get anything from $500 to $1000 depending on your bartering skills (you need to leave and re-enter dialogue at least once to get the last increment, which requires well over Barter 100%); you get half of it right away. Next you'll have to go to New Reno (which appears on your map) and get the Mine Parts from Renesco, which is very straightforward (except that you may have to deal with car thieves, see the New Reno section, quest 2). Note that if you ask Zaius for money he won't tell you the password to get the parts for free! 

Once you have the parts, return to the mine and head into it - leaving behind any party members who can't soak up about 30-50 damage without croaking. You need to use the Mine Parts on the purifier at the top of the map, so as the tunnels branch, go right, left, then left again, and you should be on the right track. As you run, you and all organic, non-canine party members plus the Robodog will occasionally take 10-15 damage, but unless you're all wimps it shouldn't be a problem, and it stops once you use the parts on the purifier (1500 xp). You can now kill off the vermin and even a deathclaw if you want to. Return outside for a reward from Zaius; if you asked for money you get the remaining half, if not you get a Combat Shotgun which is worth more.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
There is one way to avoid damage from the radon gas in the mine - wearing any kind of Power Armor, although you probably won't have it at this point. Several other kinds of protection have been said to do the trick, including having the Dermal Impact Armor, carrying or using the Oxygen Tank, running through the mine in combat mode, and having the Toughness perk. These do not work; staying in combat mode in fact means you'll take more damage. After you read a number of <i>Fallout 2</i> walkthroughs you get used to the idea that sometimes you'll be fed information which simply isn't true, speculation that at one point or another got written down as fact.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Find the missing people for Marcus.</b> 

Talk to Marcus and ask him what's new. Better tell him you'll do this for free. Over in the east part of town, you may notice there are three entrances to the underground (outhouse behind Eric's, carpet two houses east of Eric's, and manhole in field). Go down, beat up the ants (or pick them off from a distance, because your NPCs will happily fire bursts of valuable ammo at the ants if they get the chance), and walk into the room with the mutilated bodies. You get 500 xp for this. (The bodies won't show up until you've actually got the quest.) If you examine the bodies you notice they've been shot, but it makes no difference if you do or not. Take the note from the severed female body and read it. Your character will say you'd better not tell Marcus about the note... and in fact, you can't. If you talk to Zaius he only sends you to Francis. Turns out Francis killed those people... in self-defence, he says. You'll have to let him go, for 1000 xp, because if you attack him the whole town comes to his aid. The next step is to tell Marcus about the bodies. You should put this off until you've done quests 4 and 5 though, because Marcus will put Jacob away if he hasn't already done so. If you asked for money before you get $500, else he hands you a Scoped Hunting Rifle which is worth more. 

<b></b></li><li><b>Beat Francis at arm wrestling.</b> 

Francis is the super mutant in the bar. For you to have any realistic chance of beating him, your ST and EN should correspond to 9/9 or better (8/10 will work, though you may have to reload a lot). Taking two Buffout should do the trick. You need ST 8 just to take him on, and must be level 6 or higher. There's a random element, so save before trying. If you lose, you'll find yourself the not-so-proud owner of a Ball Gag. If you win, Francis gives you a Power Fist and you gain 350 xp. Make sure you do this before you confront him with the note in quest 2.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
|IN&lt;4: You need IN 2 to challenge Francis; the other requirements are the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
You can use 2 Buffout on Francis and wait 6 hours for his stats to drop, allowing you to beat him a little more easily (8/5 should be enough). The effect is smaller than if you use them on yourself, though, so this is for when you just can't get your own stats into range, or you live in fear of chem addiction. There's no point in saving after using the chems on him, since the game doesn't save such changes to critters and he'll be back to normal once you reload.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Break Manson and Franc out of prison.</b> 

Talk to Jacob and don't tell him you like mutants (if you do you can't get this quest any more). You can go to Marcus right away and turn Jacob and Aileen in for 2500 xp... but that's unnecessary. Instead go to the jail, and make sure it's daytime and that you don't have a weapon ready, or the guards may shoot you on sight. There are basically three ways to solve the quest: 

<ul type="disc">
<li>With IN 7 and CH 7 you can talk the guard into giving you the key.
</li><li>You can kill the guards (beware that Minigun) without anyone else in town noticing and take the key.
</li><li>Unlock the door using Lockpick, or obtain the key through stealing (quite difficult even with good Steal) or barter (it's worth $0) and use that. You have to wait until the guard walks to the far end of the room, since he will stop you if he sees you tampering with the door (Sneak helps), and attack if this happens two times separated by more than a few seconds. A trick once you've unlocked the door is to walk into one of the adjacent rooms and one of your party members will probably walk through the jail door for you, assuming you have any.
</li></ul><br>

Once the door is open you're teleported back to Jacob for 1500 xp. If you fought the guards or if you were given the key you don't have to free the prisoners to return to Jacob for the next quest, though you get no xp for this one until you return and open the door (but you can do this even after you turn Jacob in, in which case Franc and Manson end up in Jacob's house while Jacob remains in prison).

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Talk to Manson through the bars <i>before</i> talking to Jacob, ask him about Broken Hills and choose the long answer. You'll get 300 xp for "preaching open-mindedness to Manson". If you talk to Franc before getting this quest and tell him you hate mutants, he sends you to Jacob with a recommendation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Beware that if you choose the "Err... no, not really" line, the guard will turn hostile in about a minute, which could catch you a bit off guard.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Blow up the mine's air purifier.</b> 

Jacob will give you this task after you complete quest 4. The objective is to bring the Explosive Switch to the mine purifier. Now's a good time to turn him in! Go to Marcus and tell him all about the evil plans and you gain 2500 xp. Jacob and his band will end up in the jail. The same thing happens if you tell Marcus where he can find the escaped convicts. 

If you want to go through with the plan, run into the mine (see quest 1 for details) and use the switch on the purifier. (Using the switch after you expose the conspiracy will just make it disappear.) You'll gain 1500 xp and be teleported outside the mine. Return to Jacob and he'll say you can go loot Liz' basement for a reward (works the same as if you hear about it from Phil). You'll notice there are no mutants left in town except for Elmo the drunk, and Bill closes down his store and offers no more jobs. 

<b></b></li><li><b>Divert more electrical power to Eric's home.</b> 

p.
  Eric's in the east part of town. Agree to get him more power for his air conditioning. Go to the power station at the entrance to town, and either talk Brian into giving Eric additional power using Speech (you only get one shot at this dialogue path), or use Science on the computer to the left, and you get 1000 xp. If you manage a critical success on the computer you get 1500 xp instead for optimizing the power grid. If you fail critically you'll get shocked for 10-15 points of damage. Return to Eric for a reward of either $150, one dose of Buffout (you won't be offered this if you already beat Francis), or extra karma and the location of NCR. I'd take the Buffout.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Need more Buffout to beat Francis at armwrestling? You can steal a lot more of it and some Mentats from Eric. <i>And</i> the $150. So maybe you should choose the karma reward instead. :)</blockquote>
</li></ol>
